<p>“<span class="smcap">Who</span> goes there?”</p>

<p>I hear it yet, the ringing challenge from the war
offices of Europe. Automatically my hand slides
over my left hip. But to-day my tailored skirt
drapes smoothly there.</p>

<p>The chamois bag that for months has bulged beneath
is gone. As regularly as I fastened my garters
every morning I have been wont to buckle the safety
belt about my waist and straighten the bag at my
side and feel with careful fingers for its tight shut
clasp. You have to be thoughtful like that when
you’re carrying credentials on which at any moment
your personal safety, even your life may depend.
As faithfully as I looked under the bed at night I
always counted them over: my letter of credit for
$3,000, my blue enveloped police book, and my passport
criss-crossed with visés in the varied colours of
all the rubber stamps that must officially vouch for
me along my way. Ah, they were still all there.
And with a sigh of relief I was wont to retire to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
pillow with the sense of one more day safely done.</p>

<p>The long steel lines I have passed, I cannot forget.
“Who goes there?” These that speak with
authority are men with pistols in their belts and
swords at their sides. And there are rows of them, O
rows and rows of them along the way to the front.
See the cold glitter of them! I still look nervously
first over one shoulder and then over the other. This
morning at breakfast a waiter only drops a fork.
And I jump at the sound as if a shot had been fired.
You know the feeling something’s going to catch
you if you don’t watch out. Well, you have it like
that for a long time after you’ve been in the war
zone. Will it be a submarine or a Zeppelin or a
khaki clad line of steel?</p>

<p>It was on a summer’s day in 1916 that I rushed
into the office of the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite>. “Look!” I
exclaimed excitedly to the editor at his desk. “See
the message in the sky written in letters of blood
above the battlefields of Europe! There it is, the
promise of freedom for women!”</p>

<p>He brushed aside the magazine “lay out” before
him, and lifted his eyes to the horizon of the world.
And he too saw. Among the feminists of New York
he has been known as the man with the vision.
“Yes,” he agreed, “you are right. It is the wonder
that is coming. Will you go over there and find
out just what this terrible cataclysm of civilisation
means to the woman’s cause?”</p>

<p>And he handed me my European commission.
The next morning when I applied for my passport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
I began to be written down in the great books of
judgment which the chancelleries of the nations keep
to-day. Hear the leaves rustle as the pages chronicle
my record in full. I must clear myself of the
charge of even a German relative-in-law. I must
be able to tell accurately, say, how many blocks
intervene between the Baptist Church and the city
hall in the town where I was born. They want to
know the colour of my husband’s eyes. They will
ask for all that is on my grandfather’s tombstone.
They must have my genealogy through all my greatest
ancestors. I have learned it that I may tell it
glibly. For I shall scarcely be able to go round the
block in Europe, you see, without meeting some military
person who must know.</p>

<p>Even in New York, every consul of the countries
to which I wish to proceed, puts these inquiries before
my passport gets his visé. It is the British consul
who is holding his in abeyance. He fixes me
with a look, and he charges: “You’re not a suffragist,
are you? Well,” he goes on severely, “they
don’t want any trouble over there. I don’t know
what they’ll do about you over there.” And his
voice rises with his disapproval: “I don’t at all
know that I ought to let you go.”</p>

<p>But finally he does. And he leans across his desk and passes
me the pen with which to “sign on the dotted line.” It is the
required documentary evidence. He feels reasonably sure now that
the Kaiser and I wouldn’t speak if we passed by. And for the rest?
Well, all governments demand to know very<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_16">[16]</span> particularly who goes there when it happens
to be a woman. You’re wishing trouble on yourself to be a suffragist
almost as much as if you should elect to be a pacifist or an alien
enemy. There is a prevailing opinion—which is a hang-over from say
1908 —that you may break something, if it is only a military rule.
Why are you wandering about the world anyhow? You’ll take up a man’s
place in the boat in a submarine incident. You’ll be so in the way in a
bombardment. And you’ll eat as much sugar in a day as a soldier. So, do
your dotted lines as you’re told.</p>

<p>They dance before my eyes in a dotted itinerary.
It stretches away and away into far distant lands,
where death may be the passing event in any day’s
work. I shall face eternity from, say, the time that
I awake to step into the bath tub in the morning until,
having finished the last one hundredth stroke
with the brush at night, I lay my troubled head on
the pillow to rest uneasily beneath a heavy magazine
assignment. “There’s going to be some risk,”
the editor of the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite> said to me that
day in his office, with just a note of hesitation in his
voice. “I’ll take it,” I agreed.</p>

<p>The gangway lifts in Hoboken. We are cutting
adrift from the American shore. Standing at the
steamship’s rail, I am gazing down into faces that
are dear. Slowly, surely they are dimming through
the ocean’s mists. Shall I ever again look into eyes
that look back love into mine?</p>

<p>I think, right here, some of the sparkle begins to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
fade from the great adventure on which I am embarked.
We are steaming steadily out to sea.
Whither? It has commenced, that anxious thought
for every to-morrow, that is with a war zone traveller
even in his dreams. A cold October wind whips
full in my face. I shiver and turn up my coat collar.
But is it the wind or the pain at my heart? I can
no longer see the New York sky line for the tears
in my eyes. And I turn in to my stateroom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There on the white counterpane of my berth
stretches a life-preserver thoughtfully laid out by
my steward. On the wall directly above the wash-stand,
a neatly printed card announces: “The occupant
of this room is assigned to Lifeboat 17 on the
starboard side.” It makes quite definitely clear the
circumstances of ocean travel. This is to be no holiday
jaunt. One ought at least to know how to wear
a life-preserver. Before I read my steamer letters,
I try mine on. It isn’t a “perfect 36.” “But they
don’t come any smaller,” the steward says. “You
just have to fold them over so,” and he ties the
strings tight. Will they hold in the highest sea, I
wonder.</p>

<p>The signs above the washstands, I think, have been
seen by pretty nearly every one before lunch time.
When we who are taking the Great Chance together,
assemble in the dining-room, each of us has glimpsed
the same shadowy figure at the wheel in the pilot
house. We all earnestly hope it will be the captain
who will take us across the Atlantic. But we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
know also that it may be the ghostly figure of the
boatman Charon who will take us silently across the
Styx.</p>

<p>Whatever else we may do on this voyage, we shall
have to be always going-to-be-drowned. It is a
curiously continuously present sensation. I don’t
know just how many of my fellow travellers go to
bed at night with the old nursery prayer in their
minds if not on their lips. But I know that for me
it is as vivid as when I was four years old:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now I lay me down to sleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray the Lord my soul to keep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And should I die before I wake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray the Lord my soul to take.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Each morning I awake in faint surprise that I am still here in
this same seasick world. The daily promenade begins with a tour of
inspection to one’s personal lifeboat. Everybody does it. You wish
to make sure that it has not sprung a leak over night. Then you lean
over the steamship’s rail to look for the great letters four feet high
and electrically illuminated after dark, for all prowling undersea
German craft to notice that this is the neutral <em>New Amsterdam</em>
of the Holland-American line. Submarine warfare has not yet reached
its most savage climax. Somebody says with confident courage: “Now
that makes us quite safe, don’t you think?” And somebody answers as
promptly as expected. “Oh, I’m sure they wouldn’t sink us when they see
that sign.” And no one speaks the thought that’s plain in every<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> face: “But Huns make
‘mistakes.’ And remember the <em>Lusitania</em>.”</p>

<p>We always are remembering the <em>Lusitania</em>. I
never dress for dinner at night without recalling:
And they went down in evening clothes. We play
cards. We dance on deck. But never does one
completely while away the recurring thought:
Death snatched them as suddenly as from this my
next play or as from the Turkey Trot or the Maxixe
that the band is just beginning.</p>

<p>We read our Mr. Britlings but intermittently.
The plot in which we find ourselves competes with
the best seller. Subconsciously I am always listening
for the explosion. If the Germans don’t do it
with a submarine, it may be a floating mine that the
last storm has lashed loose from its moorings.</p>

<p>What is this? Rumour spreads among the steamer
chairs. Everybody rises. Little groups gather
with lifted glasses. And—it is a piece of driftwood
sighted on the wide Atlantic. That thrill walks off
in about three times around the deck.</p>

<p>But what is that, out there, beyond the steamer’s
path? Right over there where the fog is lifting?
Surely, yes, that shadowy outline. Don’t you see
it? Why, it’s growing larger every minute. I believe
it is! Oh, yes, I’m sure they look like that.
Wait. Well, if it were, it does seem as if the torpedo
would have been here by now. Ah, we shall
not be sunk this time after all! Our periscope
passes. It is clearly now only a steamship’s funnel
against the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>Then one day there is an unusual stir of activity
on deck. The sailors are stripping the canvas from
off the lifeboats. The great crane is hauling the life
rafts from out the hold. Oh, what is going to happen?
The most nervous passenger wants right away
to know. And the truthful answer to her query is,
that no one can tell. But we are making ready now
for shipwreck. In these days, methodically, like this
it is done. It has to be, as you approach the more
intense danger zone of a mined coast. You see you
never can tell.</p>

<p>I go inside once more to try the straps of my
life-preserver. But we are sailing through a sunlit
sea. And at dinner the philosopher at our table—he
is a Hindu from Calcutta—says smilingly, “Now this
will do very nicely for shipwreck weather, gentlemen,
very nicely for shipwreck weather.” It is the
round-faced Hollander at my right, of orthodox
Presbyterian faith, who protests earnestly, “Ah, but
please no. Do not jest.” The next day when the
dishes slide back and forth between the table racks,
none of us laugh when the Hollander says solemnly,
“See, but if God should call us now.” Ah, if he
should, our life boats would never last us to Heaven.
They would crumple like floats of paper in Neptune’s
hand. Eating our dessert, we look out on
the terrible green and white sea that licks and slaps
at the portholes and all of us are very still. The
lace importer from New York at my left, is the
most quiet of all.</p>

<p>For eight days and nights we have escaped all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the perils of the deep. And now it is the morning
of the ninth day. You count them over like that
momentously as God did when he made the world.
What will to-morrow bring forth? Well, one prepares
of course for landing.</p>

<p>I sit up late, nervously censoring my note book
through. The nearer we get to the British coast,
the more incriminating it appears to be familiar with
so much as the German woman movement. I dig
my blue pencil deep through the name of Frau Cauer.
I rip open the package of my letters of introduction.
What will they do to a person who is going to meet
a pacifist by her first name? That’s a narrow escape.
Another letter is signed by a perfectly good loyal
American who, however, has the misfortune to have
inherited a Fatherland name from some generations
before. Oh, I cannot afford to be acquainted with
either of my friends. I’ve got to be pro-ally all
wool and yard wide clear to the most inside seams
of my soul. I’ve got to avoid even the appearance
of guilt. So, stealthily I tiptoe from my stateroom
to drop both compromising letters into the sea.</p>

<p>Like this a journalist goes through Europe these
days editing oneself, to be acceptable to the rows
of men in khaki. So I edit and I edit and I edit myself
until after midnight for the British government’s
inspection. I try to think earnestly. What would
a spy do? So that I may avoid doing it. And I
go to bed so anxious lest I act like a spy that I dream
I am one. When I awake on the morning of the
tenth day, all our engines are still. And from bow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
to stern, our boat is all a-quiver with glad excitement.
We have not been drowned! There beside us dances
the little tender to take us ashore at Falmouth.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p class="center">FACING THE STEEL LINE OF INQUIRY</p>

<p>The good safe earth is firm beneath our feet before
the lace importer speaks. Then, looking out
on the harbor, he says: “On my last business trip
over a few months since, my steamship came in here
safely. But the boat ahead and the next behind
each struck a mine.” So the chances of life are like
that, sometimes as close as one in three. But while
you take them as they come, there are lesser difficulties
that it’s a great relief to have some one to do
something about. At this very moment I am devoutly
glad for the lace importer near at hand. He
is carrying my bag and holding his umbrella over
me in the rain. For, you see, he is an American
man. The more I have travelled, the more certain
I have become that it’s a mistake to be a woman anywhere
in the world there aren’t American men around. In
far foreign lands I have found myself instinctively
looking round the landscape for their first aid.
The others, I am sure, mean well. But they aren’t
like ours. An Englishman gave me his card last night
at dinner: “Now if I can do anything for you in
London,” he said, and so forth. It was the American
man now holding his umbrella over me in the rain,
who came yesterday to my steamer chair: “It’s
going to be dark to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
night in London,” he said, “and the taxicabs are
scarce. You must let me see that you reach your
hotel in safety.” And I felt as sure a reliance in
him as if we’d made mud pies together or he’d carried
my books to school. You see, you count on an
American man like that.</p>

<p>But the cold line of steel! That you have to do
alone, even as you go each soul singly to the judgment
gate of heaven. I grip my passport hard. It
has been removed from its usual place of secure
safety. Chamois bags are the eternal bother of
being a woman abroad in war-time. Men have
pockets, easy ones to get at informally. I have
among my “most important credentials”—they are
in separate packages carefully labelled like that—a
special “diplomatic letter” commending me officially
by the Secretary of State to the protection of
all United States embassies and consulates. When
they handed it to me in Washington, I remember
they told me significantly: “We have just picked
out of prison over there, two American correspondents
whose lives we were able to save by the narrowest
chance. We don’t want any international
complications. Now, do be careful.”</p>

<p>I’m going to be. The Tower of London and some
modern Bastille on the banks of the Seine and divers
other dark damp places of detention over here are
at this minute clearly outlining themselves as moving
pictures before my mind. I earnestly don’t want
to be in any of them.</p>

<p>We have reached the temporary wooden shack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
through which governments these days pass all who
knock for admission at their frontiers. Inside the
next room there at a long pine table sit the men with
pistols in their belts and swords at their sides, whose
business it is to get spies when they see them. We
are to be admitted one by one for the relentless fire
of their cross-questioning. They have taken “British
subjects first.” Now they summon “aliens.”</p>

<p>To be called an alien in a foreign land feels at
once like some sort of a charge. You never were
convicted of this before. And it seems like the
most unfortunate thing you can possibly be now.
Besides, I am every moment becoming more acutely
conscious of my mission. The rest of these my fellow
travellers, it is true, are aliens. I am worse.
For a journalist even in peace times appears a most
suspiciously inquiring person who wishes to know
everything that should not be found out. But in
peace times one has only to handle individuals. In
war-times one has to handle governments. The burden
of proof rests heavier and heavier upon me.
How shall I convince England that in spite of all,
I can be a most harmless, pleasant person?</p>

<p>From the decision the other side of that door, there
will be no appeal. The men in khaki there have
authority to confiscate my notes—or me! And they
are so particular about journalists. One friend of
mine back from the front a month ago had his
clothes turned inside out and they ripped the lining
from his coat. Then there is the lemon acid bath,
lest you carry notes in invisible writing on your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
skin. They do it, rumor says, in Germany. But
who can tell when other War Offices will have
adopted this efficiency method? Oh, dear, what is
the use not to have been drowned if one must face
an inquisition? And they may turn me back on
the next boat. My thoughts are with the lemon
acid bath. How many lemons will it take to fill
the tub, I am speculatively computing, when “Next,”
says the soldier. And it is I.</p>

<p>A battery of searching eyes is turned on me. I
am face to face with my first steel line. The words
of the British consul again ring warningly in my
ears, “I don’t at all know what they’ll do about you
over there.”</p>

<p>No one ever does know these days. It’s the tormenting
uncertainty that keeps you literally guessing
from day to day whether you’re going or coming.
And on what least incidents does human judgment
depend. Perhaps they’d like me better if my
hat were blue instead of brown. Thank heaven I
didn’t economise on the price of my travelling coat.
I step bravely forward when the officer at the head
of the table reaches out his hand for my passport.</p>

<p>In the upper left hand corner is attached my photograph.
The Department of State at Washington requires it for
all travellers now before they affix the great red
seal that gives authenticity to the personal
information recorded in this paper. From the passport
photograph to my face, the officer glances
sharply, suspiciously, like a bank teller looking for
a forgery. I feel him looking straight through me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to the very curl at the back of my neck. Ah, apparently
it is I!</p>

<p>“Now what have you come over here for?” he inquires
in a tone of voice that seems to say, “Nobody
asked you to England. We’re quite too busy about
other things to entertain strangers.”</p>

<p>I hand him my official journalistic letter addressed
“To Whom it may Concern.” Signed by the editor
of the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite>, it states that I am delegated
to study the new position of women due to
the war. Will he want me to? He may be as
sensitive as the British consul in New York about
the woman movement. He may prefer that it
should not move at all.</p>

<p>I hold my breath while he reads the letter. Then
I have to talk. I tell him, I think, the complete
story of my life. I show him all of my credentials.
I give him my photograph. You always have to
do that. Photographs that are duplicates of the one
on your passport, you must carry by the dozen. You
have to leave them like visiting cards with gentlemen
in khaki all over Europe.</p>

<p>Well, what is he going to do about me? I get
out my letters of social introduction. There are 84!
I strew them on the table for him to read. There
is a door just behind his head. Will it be in there,
the search and the confiscation and the lemon acid
bath? I wonder, and I wonder. But I try to
stand very still. If I move one foot, it might jar
the decision that is forming in the officer’s mind. I
am watching alertly for his expression. But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
isn’t any. I can’t tell at all whether he likes me.
An Englishman is always like that, completely shut
up behind his face. It may be at this very moment
he has made up his mind that I am a spy. He has
read only four letters——</p>

<p>And he looks up suddenly, in his hand the letter
from Mrs. Belmont in New York introducing me to
the Duchess of Marlborough. He nods down the
line to all the other military eyes fixed on me:
“She’s all right. Let her go.”</p>

<p>I sign on the dotted line. And everything is over!
In a flashing moment like that, it is accomplished.
And a letter to “Our Duchess” has done it. At the
magic of the name of the American woman who was
Consuelo Vanderbilt, this steel like line of British
officers quietly sheathes all opposition!</p>

<p>The soldier at the other end of the room opens a
little wooden door in a wooden wall that lets me
into England. My baggage is already being chalk
marked “passed.” I am here! I clutch my passport
happily and convulsively in my hand. You
have to do that until you can restore it to the safer
place. It’s the most important item in what the
French call your “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pieces de identité</i>.” At any moment
a policeman in the Strand, a gendarme in the
Avenue de l’Opéra may tap an alien on the shoulder
with the pertinent inquiry, Who are you?</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE WAY OF JOURNALISM IN WAR TIME NOT EASY</p>

<p>London, when we reached it that night in October,
lay under the black pall of darkness in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
cities over here have enveloped themselves against
war. Death rides above in the sky. To-night,
every to-night, it may be the Zeppelins will come.
Over there on the horizon, a searchlight streams suddenly
and another and another, their great fingers
feeling through the black clouds for the monsters of
destruction that may be winging a way above the
chimney pots. Every building is tightly shuttered.
The street lamps with their globes painted three-quarters
black have their pale lights as it were hid
beneath an inverted bushel. Pedestrians must develop
a protective sense that enables them to find
their way at night as a cat does in the dark. “I’m
sorry,” says an apologetic English voice, and before
you know it, you have bumped against another
passerby. There is another sudden jolt. And you
are scrambling for your balance the other side of the
curb you couldn’t see was there. If you are familiar
with the door knob where you’re going to stop, you
will be so much the surer where you’re at.</p>

<p>Looking out on this darkest London from Paddington
railway station at midnight I sit on my trunk
and wait. Do you remember the popular song,
There’s a Little Street in Heaven Called Broadway?
Oh, I hope there is.</p>

<p>I sit on my trunk and wait. In my handbag is
the card of the Englishman politely ready to look
after me in London. It is the American man who is
out there in the night endeavouring to commandeer
a taxicab. Somehow he has done it. At last the
cab comes. He has compelled the chauffeur to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
us. I shall not have to sit all night on my trunk.</p>

<p>A small green light within the hooded entrance,
picks the Ritz Hotel out of the Piccadilly blackness.
Inside, after the gloom through which we have come,
I gasp with relief. It is as if one discovers suddenly
in a place that has seemed a graveyard, Why, people
still live here! Right then at the hotel register, the
voice of Scotland Yard speaks for the War Office.
And before the Ritz can be permitted to give me
refuge from the night, I must answer. The “registration
blank” presented for me to fill in, demands
certain definite information: “(1) Surname. (2)
Christian names. (3) Nationality. (4) Birthplace.
(5) Year of birth. (6) Sex. (7) Full residential
address: Full business address. (8) Trade or
occupation. (9) Served in what army, navy or police
force. (10) Full address where arrived from.
(11) Date of signing. (12) Signature.” And a
little below, “(13) Full address of destination.
(14) Date of departure. (15) Signature.” A
last line in conspicuous italics admonishes: “Penalty
for failing to give this information correctly 100
pounds or six months imprisonment.” Well, of
course a threat like that will make even a woman tell
her age as many times as she is asked. But I do it
rebelliously against the Kaiser and all his Prussians.
For the “registration blank” was made in Germany.
I remember it before the war, at the Hotel Adlon in
Berlin.</p>

<p>I must sign now on the dotted line before I can
even go to bed. I arrange my clothing carefully on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
a chair within reach of my hand. You rest that way
in a warring city, always ready to run. The Zeppelins
may come so swiftly. In London you know
your nearest cellar. In France you have selected
your high vaulted entrance arch under which to take
refuge when the sirens go screaming down the street,
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardez vous, Gardez vous.</i>”</p>

<p>The sense of depression that had enwrapped me in
the first darkness of London was not gone when I
closed my eyes in sleep. One does not throw it off.
You may not be of those who are wearing crêpe.
But you cannot escape the woe of the world which
will enfold you like a garment.</p>

<p>In the morning the ordinary business of living has
become one of strenuous detail. The law requires
that an alien shall register with the police within 24
hours of arrival. When I have thus established a
calling acquaintance at the Vine Street station, I go
out into Piccadilly feeling like a prisoner politely on
parole. And I face an environment strung all over
with barbed wire restrictions on my movements.
Every letter that comes for me from America will be
read before I receive it, marked “Opened by the Censor.”
If I wish to go away from this country, I
must ask the permission of the Foreign Office, the
consulate of the country to which I wish to proceed
and my own consulate before I can so much as purchase
a ticket. I may not leave London for any “restricted
area” where there has been an Irish revolution
or a German bombardment without the consent of
Scotland Yard. I may not even leave the Ritz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Hotel, which is registered as my official place of residence,
for more steam-heat at the Savoy, without
notifying the Vine Street Station of my departure
and the Bow Street Station of my arrival. The Defence
of the Realm and the Trading with the Enemy
Acts and others in a land at war are lying around
like bombs all over the place. Have a care that you
don’t run into them!</p>

<p>I am alone one evening at the International Suffrage
Headquarters in Adam Street, deep lost in a
sociological study of carefully filed data. Do you
believe in subconscious warnings? Anyhow, I am
bending over a box of manila envelopes when suddenly,
out of the silence of this top floor room, I am
impressed with a sense of danger. It is as plain and
clear as if a voice over my shoulder said “Look out.”
I do look up quickly. And there on the wall before
my eyes, I read Order 4 from the Defence of the
Realm Act, commonly enough posted all over London,
I discover later. But this is the first time I
have seen it. It reads: “The curtains of this room
must be drawn at sundown.” And from two windows
with wide open curtains, my brilliant electric
light is streaming out on the London darkness, oh, as
far as Trafalgar Square for all the German Zeppelins
and Scotland Yard to see! Just for an instant I am
paralysed with the fear of them all. Then my hand
finds the electric button and I hastily switch myself
into the protecting darkness. Somehow I grope my
way through the hall and down the staircase. And I
slam the outer door hurriedly. There, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
police arrive, I shall be gone! In the morning paper
a week or so afterward I read one day of an earl’s
daughter even, who had been arrested and fined 25
pounds for “permitting a beam of light to escape
from her window.”</p>

<p>The government is regulating everything, the icing
a housewife may not put on a cake, the number of
courses one may have for dinner, even the conversation
at table. Let an American with the habit of
free speech beware! Notices conspicuously posted
in public places advise, “Silence.” In France they
put it most picturesquely, “Say nothing. Be suspicious.
The ears of the enemy are always open.”
Absolutely the only safe rule, then, is to learn to
hold your tongue. Everybody’s doing it over here.
Very well, I will not talk. But what about all the
rest of this silent world that will not, either? For
those under military orders, the rule is absolute.
And you’ve no idea how many people are under military
orders. This is a war with even the women in
khaki. I begin to feel that to get into so much as a
drawing-room, I ought to have my merely social letter
of introduction crossed with some kind of a visé.
Wouldn’t a hostess, even the Duchess of Marlborough,
be able to be more cordial if she knew that I
had seen the Government before I saw her? Even
the girl conductor on the ’bus this morning, when I
essayed to ask her as Exhibit 1 in the new-woman-in-industry
I was looking for, how she liked her job,
turned and scurried down her staircase like a frightened
rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>So, this is not to be the simple life for research
work. And though I come through all the submarines
and the lines of steel, and the Zeppelins have
not got me yet, what shall it profit me to save my
life and lose my assignment? I am bound for the
front and for certain information I am to gather on
the way. Now, what should a journalist do?</p>

<p>Well, a journalist, I discovered, should get one’s
self personally conducted by Lord Northcliffe.
There were those of my masculine contemporaries
already headed for the front whom he was said on
arrival here to have received into the bosom of his
newspaper office and put to bed to rest from the
nervous exhaustion of travel, and sent a secretary
and a check and anything else to make them happy.
And then he asked them only to name the day they
wanted to see Woolwich or to cross to France. But
nothing like that was happening to me. So what
else should a journalist do?</p>

<p>Well, evidently a journalist should get in good
standing with a war office which alone can press the
button to everywhere she wants to go. The short
cut to a war office is through a press bureau. But a
press bureau modestly shrinks from the publicity that
it purveys. You do not find it on Main Street with
a lettered signboard and a hand pointing: “Journalists,
right this way.” And you can’t run right
up the front steps of a war office and ring the bell.
It would be a what-do-you-call-it, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i> if you
did. Even for a private residence it would be that.
There isn’t anywhere that I know of over here even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
in peace time that as soon as you reach town you can
call a hostess up on the telephone and have her say,
“Oh, you’re the friend of Sallie Smith that she’s
written me about. Come right along up to dinner.”
Why, the butler would tell you her ladyship or her
grace or something like that was not at home. It
just can’t be done like that outside of America.
You don’t rush into the best English circles that way,
much less the English government. Absolutely your
only way around is through a formal correspondence.</p>

<p>One day I wrap myself in the rose satin down
bed-quilt at the Ritz and spread out my letters of
introduction to choose a journalistic lead. There
are carved cupids on the walls of this bedroom, and
a lovely rose velvet carpet on the floor and heavy
rose silk hanging at the windows. But there isn’t
any place to be warm. The tiny open grate holds
six or it may be seven coals—you see why Dickens
always writes of “coals” in the plural—and you put
them on delicately with things like the sugar tongs.
It isn’t good form to be warm in England. The
best families aren’t. It’s plebeian and American
even to want to be.</p>

<p>My soul is all curled up with the cold while I am
trying to determine which letter. This to Sir Gilbert
Parker was the 84th letter handed me by the
editor of the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite> as I stepped on the
boat. It is the one I now select first, quite by chance,
without the least idea of where it is to lead me. The
next evening at 6 o’clock I am on my way to Wellington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
House. “Sir Gilbert,” speaks the attendant
in resplendent livery. And I find myself in a stately
English room. There, down the length of the red
velvet carpet beneath the glow of a red shaded electric
lamp, a man with very quiet eyes is rising from
his chair. “Do you know where you are?” he asks
with a smile, glancing at the letter of introduction on
his desk that tells of my mission. “This,” he says,
“is the headquarters of the English government’s
press bureau for the war and I am in charge of the
American publicity.” Who cares for Lord Northcliffe
now! Or even the King of England! Of all
the inhabitants of this land, here was the man a
journalist would wish to meet. The man who has
written “The Seats of the Mighty” sits in them.
From his desk here in the red room he can touch the
button that will open all the right doors to me. He
can’t do it immediately, in war-time. One has to
make sure first. I must come often to Wellington
House. There are days when we talk of many
things, of life and of New York. He is less and less
of a formal Englishman. His title is slipping away.
He is beginning to be just Gilbert Parker, who might
have belonged to the Authors’ League up on Forty-second
Street. I half suspect he does. “I do know
my America rather well,” he says at length. “I
married a girl from Fifty-seventh Street. And I
have a brother who lives in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul.”</p>

<p>It is the way his voice thrills on “my America.”
I am sure any American correspondent hearing it
would have been ready even in the fall of 1916 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
clasp hands across the sea in the Anglo-American
compact to win this war. Gilbert Parker is in tune
with the American temperament. He doesn’t wear
a monocle. And he says to a woman “Now, what
can I do for you?” in just the tone of voice that an
American man would use when everything is going
to be all right. I remember the red room just before
he said it. Everything hung in the balance for me
at this moment: “I have confidence in Mr. Vance,
your editor. I know him,” reflects the man who is
deciding. “But—are you in ‘Who’s Who’?” Just
for the lack of a line in a book, a government’s good
favour might have been lost! But he reached for the
copy above his desk. “Any more credentials?” he
asks. I cast desperately about in my mind—and
drop a Phi Beta key in his hand. “I won’t take
that up on you,” he says with a smile. And my
cause is won.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE WAY IT IS DONE</p>

<p>Long important envelopes lettered across the top
“On His Majesty’s Service” begin to arrive in my
mail. All the government offices will be “at home”
and helpful—when a personal interview has further
convinced each that I am clearly not at all a German
person nor the dangerous species of the suffragist.
Where are the slippers that will match this gown?
And which are the beads that will be best? Mine is
a hazardous undertaking, you see, that requires all of
the art at the command of a woman: I must so state
the mission on which I have come that <em>my</em> woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
movement may seem pleasing in the eyes of a man—why,
possibly a man whose country house even may
have been burned in behalf of votes for women!
Clearly I must mind my phrases, to get my permits.
And if you’re a journalist in war-time, you need the
permit as you do your daily bread.</p>

<p>To get it, you write about it and call about it and
write about it some more. And then it comes like
this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Foreign Office</span>, Nov. 6, 1917.</p>

<p class="yours">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="sig">G. S. B.</p>
</div>

<p>Or it comes like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p>England in war-time is open for my inspection.
I am getting my data nicely when one day there
develops the dilemma of getting away with it. I
open the <cite>Times</cite> one morning to read a new law:
“On and after Dec. 1,” the newspaper announces,
“no one may be permitted to take out of England
any photograph or printed or written material other
than letters.” I have a trunkful. Clearly I can’t
get by any khaki line with that concealed about my
person. Sir Gilbert walks twice, three times up and
down the red room. “I’ll see what I can do about
it,” he says. “I don’t know. But I’ll try.” A few
days later my data begins to go right through all
the laws.</p>

<p>“First consignment,” I cabled across the Atlantic,
“coming on the <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis</em>, if it doesn’t strike a mine.”
I follow it with a registered letter to the editor: “I
hope God and you will always be good to Gilbert
Parker. And now if I don’t get back—” And I
give him exact directions about the material on the
way. For it is no idle imagining that I may not
reach home.</p>

<p>I am facing France and the Channel crossing.
Here in London it is so long since the Zeppelins
have been heard from that we are almost lulled into
a sense of security that they will not come again.
If they do high government circles usually hear in
advance. A friend whose cousin’s brother-in-law is
in the Admiralty will let me know as soon as he finds
out. But now all of these neatly arranged life and
death plans must go into the discard. For you see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
I am changing my danger back again from Zeppelins
to submarines.</p>

<p>Let us see about the sinkings. Rumour reports
now that about four out of six boats are getting
across. I may get one of the four. On the night
train from London, I wrap myself in my steamer-rug
in the unheated compartment. Travelling is not
what you might say encouraged. This journey to
Paris, accomplished ordinarily in four hours, will
now take twenty-four. No two time-tables will anywhere
connect. There are as many difficulties as can
possibly be arranged. Governments don’t want you
doing this every day in the week. And there is always
a question whether you will be permitted to do
it at all. At Southampton I must meet the steel
line with the challenge, “Who goes there?”</p>

<p>Again I tell all my life to the man with a pistol at
his belt and a sword at his side. He looks a second
time at my passport: “You want to go all sorts of
places you’ve no business to,” he says sharply.</p>

<p>“Not all of them now,” I answer humbly, “only
France.” “Well, why even France?” he persists
testily. I try to tell him. I present for a second
consideration one of my “most important credentials.”
It is a personal letter from the French consul
in New York specially and cordially recommending
me to the “care and protection of all the civil and
military authorities in France.” At last he tosses the
letter inquiringly down his khaki line as much as to
say, “Oh, well, if they want her over there?” It
comes back with a nod of acquiescence from the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
man, and a visé in purple ink lets me through to the
boat.</p>

<p>Shall I remember the <em>Sussex</em>? You don’t so
much after you’ve lived daily with death for a while.
Some time during the night I am drowsily conscious
that the boat begins to move. A skilled pilot has
taken the wheel to guide us in and out among mines
placed perilously as a protection against German
submarines. Our lives are coming through dangerous
narrows. In the morning we are safe in Havre.
The next steel line, here, is French. And with the
letter from the consul at New York in my hand I
am literally and cordially and politely bowed into
France.</p>

<p>At my hotel in the Rue de Rivoli, the American
man opposite me at the dinner table the next day is
just about to sail, “going back to God’s country, as
far away home as I can get, to the tall pine trees on
the Pacific Coast,” he tells me. He had come to
Europe on an assignment that was to have been
accomplished in three months. It has taken him a
year to get to the front. My knife and fork drop
in despair on my plate as he says it. “Cheer up,”
he urges. “You just have to remember to take a
Frenchman’s promises as lightly as they’re made.
They always aim to please. And your hopes rise so
that you order two cocktails for dinner to-night.
Then to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow there
will be only more promises. But you’re an American
woman. You’ll dig through. Good luck,” he
says. And a taxicab takes him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WAR AS YOU FIRST SEE IT</p>

<p>Here in Paris I stand in the boulevards as I stood
in the Strand and Oxford Street, and watch the new
woman movement going by. Every time a man drops
dead in the trenches, a woman steps permanently
into the niche he used to hold in industry, in commerce,
in the professions, in world affairs. It is the
woman movement for which the ages have waited in
ghastly truth. But, O God in Heaven, the price we
pay! The price we pay! There is Madelaine La
Fontaine, whom I saw yesterday in the Rue Renouard.
Her black dress outlined her figure against
the yellow garden wall where she stood in a little
doorway. She leaned and kissed her child on his
way to school. As she lifted her head, I saw the
grief in her eyes and the dead man’s picture in the
locket at her throat.</p>

<p>They are everywhere through England and France,
these women with the locket at their throats. Yet
not for these would your heart ache most. There
are the others, the clear-eyed girls in their ’teens just
now coming up into long dresses. And life may not
offer them so much as the pictured locket! There
will be no man’s face to fill it! Love that would
have been, you see, lies slain there with all the bright
boyhood that’s falling on the battlefields. O God,
the price we pay!</p>

<p>How far off now seems that summer’s day I
walked through 39th Street, my pulses throbbing
pleasantly with the thrill of adventure and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
commission! I wonder if ever life can look like
that again. The heavens arched all blue above New
York and the sunshine lay all golden on the city
pavements. But that was before I knew. Oh, I
had heard about war, even as have you and your next
door neighbour. War was battle dates that had to
be committed to memory at school. Or if instead of
tiresome pages in history it should mobilise before
our eyes, why, of course it would be flags flying,
bands playing, and handsome heroes marching down
Fifth Avenue!</p>

<p>And now I have seen war. Every way I turn I
am looking on men with broken bodies and women
with broken hearts. War is not merely the hell that
may pass at Verdun or the Somme in the agony of a
day or a night that ends in death. War is worse.
War is that big strong fellow with eyes burned out
when he “went over the top,” whom I saw learning
to walk by a strip of oilcloth laid on the floor of the
Home for the Blind in London. They’re teaching
him now to make baskets for a living! War is that
boy in his twenties without any legs whom I met in
Regents Park in a wheel chair for the rest of his life!
War is that peasant from whom to-day I inquired my
way in one of the little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banlieues</i> of Paris. There
was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i> in his coat lapel. But he
had to set down on the ground his basket of vegetables
to point down the Quai de Bercy with his
remaining arm. You know how a Frenchman just
has to gesture when he talks? The stump of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
other arm twitched a horrible accompaniment as he
indicated my direction!</p>

<p>Those are brave men who are dying on all the
battlefields for their native lands. But oh, the bravery
of these men who must live for their countries!
These who have lost their eyes and their arms and
their legs are as common over here as, why, as, say,
men with brown hair. And these are terrible
enough. But the men who have lost their faces!
So long as they shall live, in every one’s eyes into
which they look, they must see a shudder of horror
reflecting as in a looking glass their old agony. God
in Heaven pity the men who have lost their faces!
The greatest sculptors in the world are busy to-day
making faces to be fastened on.</p>

<p>Like this you’ve got to go through Europe these
days with a sob in the throat. I turn to the difficult
details of living for relief from the awful drama of
existence. In Paris there is the nicest United States
ambassador that ever was sent in a black frock coat
to represent his country abroad. In the course of
my travels there are embassies I have met who are
about as useful to the wayfaring American in a foreign
land as a Rogers plaster group on a parlour table.
But you arrive at Mr. Sharpe’s embassy in the Rue
de Chaillot and it doesn’t matter at all if it happens
to be perhaps 4:33 and his reception hour closed at,
say, 4:31. He says, “Come right in.” Yes, he
talks like that, not at all in the tone of royalty.
“When’d you get in town?” he asks as genially as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
if it might be Albany or Detroit instead of Paris.
By this time you’re sitting in a chair drawn up to his
desk and discussing the last Democratic victory.
“How’s Charlie Murphy standing now with the
administration?” perhaps he asks, and then pretty
soon, “But what can I do for you in Paris?”</p>

<p>And he does it. You don’t have to call his secretary
a week later to ask, How about that letter the
embassy was going to give me? And the week after
and the week after ring up some more to recall that
there’s an American running up an expense account
at the hotel down the street. That’s not Mr.
Sharpe’s way. Within ten minutes he had handed
me a letter of introduction to M. Briand, Prime
Minister of France. He laughed as he passed it to
me. “Honestly, I’d hate to hand any one a gold
brick,” he said. “That document looks imposing
enough and important enough that a limousine
should be at your hotel entrance to take you to the
front at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> to-morrow. But nothing like that
will happen. In France you have to remember that
no one hurries. And an American can’t.”</p>

<p>You can hear that in every foreign language. It
was a spectacled Herr Professor in Berlin who once
said to me severely, “You Americans, this hurry it is
your national vice.” I feel that foreign governments
have duly disciplined me in this direction during
the past few months. So much of my job in
serving the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite> in Europe seems to be
to sit on a chair and wait in a War Office ante room.
At the Maison de la Presse, 3 Rue François 1st, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the Service de l’Information Diplomatique, whither
my Briand letter leads me, I seem to spend hours.</p>

<p>They are going to be charmed, as Frenchmen can
be, to take me to the front. And the days pass and
the days pass. “Ah, but you see, for a lady journalist
it is so different and so difficult. The trip must
be specially arranged.” And the weeks go by. And
M. Polignac is so polite and polite and polite—just
that and nothing more.</p>

<p>One day he says to me: “And, <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Daggett,
how long is it you will be in Paris?” “Why,” I
falter, “I hadn’t expected to winter here. I’m waiting,
you know, just waiting until I can go to the
front.” “And how much longer now could you
wait?” he inquires. “Oh,” I answer desperately,
“I’ll surely have to go by the 29th. I couldn’t stay
longer than that.”</p>

<p>So in the course of the next few days there comes
a letter telling me how it pains the French government
that they should not be able to “take that trip
in hand” before the 29th. And of course if I must
leave them on that date, as I had said I must, oh,
they so much regret, etc., etc.</p>

<p>If I intend to get to the front, evidently then I
must dig through! And in my room at the Hotel
Regina in the Rue de Rivoli, I take my pen in hand.</p>

<p>To “Maison de la Presse, Service de l’Information
Diplomatique,” I write: “Gentlemen, your favour
of the 26th inst. with your regrets just received.
And I hasten to write you that I cannot, for the sake
of France, accept your decision as final, without presenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to your attention a situation with which you
may not be familiar. You see, gentlemen, in the
country from which I come, we have a feminism that
is neither an ideal nor a theory, but a working reality.
In America, there were when I left, four million
women citizens, and the State legislatures every
little while making more. These are, gentlemen,
four million citizens with a vote, whose wishes must
be consulted by Congress at Washington in determining
the war policy of the United States. Their
sympathies help to determine the amount of the war
relief contributions that may come across the Atlantic.
These are four million women who count,
gentlemen, please understand, exactly the same as
four million men.</p>

<p>“Other American publications may offer Maison
de la Presse other facilities for reaching the American
public. But none of them can duplicate the
facilities presented by the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite>, the leading
magazine to champion the feminist cause. It is
the magazine that is read by the woman who votes.
Is not France interested in what she shall read
there?</p>

<p>“Believe me, gentlemen, the opportunity for
propaganda that I offer you is unparalleled. I beg
you therefore to reconsider. I earnestly desire to
go to the front this week. Can you, I ask, permit
me to leave this land without granting the privilege?
For the sake of France, gentlemen! Awaiting your
reply, I remain,” etc.</p>

<p>That letter was posted at 11 o’clock at night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Before noon the next day Maison de la Presse was
on the telephone and speaking English. In France
they do not hurry. It is not customary to use the
telephone. And it is at this time against the law to
speak English on it. But listen: “Will <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>.
Daggett find herself able to accept the invitation of
the French government to go to the front on Thursday?”
inquires the voice on the wire.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Close Up Behind the Lines</span></p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> is going to be perhaps a dangerous undertaking,”
says the French army officer the next day
in the reception room at Maison de la Presse. He
is speaking solemnly and impressively. “Do you
still wish to go?” he asks, addressing me in particular.
I look back steadily into his eyes. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, Monsieur.</i>”
Then his glance sweeps inquiringly the
semicircle of faces. There are six journalists and
a munitions manufacturer from Bridgeport, Connecticut.
And they all nod assent. The room is
singularly silent for an instant, the officer just standing
quietly, his left hand resting on his sword-hilt.
Then he turns and passes to each of us the official
Permis de Correspondent de la Presse aux Armees,
for our journey to Rheims the next day. And we
all sign on the dotted line.</p>

<p>Before I retire that night I rip the pink rose from
off my hat and lay out the long dark coat which is
to envelop me from my neck to my heels. It is the
camouflage which, in accordance with the army
orders, blends one with the landscape as a means of
concealment from the German gunners’ range.
Rheims is under bombardment. It was fired on yesterday.
It may be to-morrow. There must not be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the army officer has assured us, even the flower on
the lady’s hat for a target.</p>

<p>My electric light winks once. Two minutes later
it winks twice, and is gone, according to the martial
law which puts out all lights in Paris from 11:30
at night until 8 o’clock in the morning. I grope my
way to bed in the darkness and at 6 o’clock the next
morning, I dress by candle light. I count carefully
the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pieces de identité</i>” in the chamois safety bag
that hangs over my left hip and place in my hand
bag my passport and my French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">permis</i>, both of
which must be presented at the railway station before
I can purchase a ticket. I look to make sure that the
inside pocket of my purse still contains my business
card with its pencilled request: “In case of death
or disaster kindly notify the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite>, New
York City.” And as I pass the porter’s desk at the
hotel entrance I leave with the sleepy concierge one
other last message: “If <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Daggett has not returned
by midnight, will the hotel management
kindly communicate with her friend <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> Marie
Perrin, 12 Rue Ordener?” All these are precautions
that you take lest you be lost in the great European
war.</p>

<p>The Gare l’Est is crowded always with throngs of
soldiers arriving and departing for the front. It is
necessary that our party assemble as early as seven
o’clock to get in line at the ticket window for the
eight o’clock train, for every traveller’s credentials
must be separately and carefully read and inspected.
At Epernay, where we alight at 10:30, the station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
platform is densely packed with French soldiers in
the sky blue uniforms that have been so carefully
matched with the horizon color of France. A debonnair
French captain has been appointed by the
French government to receive us. He is in full
uniform, splendid scarlet trousers and gold braided
coat, with his left breast ornamented with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix
de Guerre</i> and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médaille de Honneur</i>. After the
formal salutations are over, however, his orderly envelops
all of the captain’s splendour too in the long
sky blue coat for camouflage against the Germans.
And we start for Rheims in the convoy of three luxuriously
appointed “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camoens</i>,” the limousines placed
at our disposal by the government. They, too, are
painted blue grey to blend with the landscape, and
each flies a little French flag.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ou allez vous, Monsieur?</i>” the sentry at the
bridge of Epernay challenges our chauffeur. And
the French captain himself leans from the window
to answer, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Rheims. Une mission de la gouvernement.</i>”
So we pass sentry after sentry. It is 15
miles to Rheims. This is the Department of the
Marne, with the vineyards that have produced the
most famous wines of the world. The “smiling
countryside of France,” the poets have termed it.
In September, 1914, history changed it to the grim
field of carnage running red with the blood of civilisation
that here made its stand against the onrushing
Huns. Right across that valley see the battlefield
of the Marne. Along this road the German army
passed. From this little village that we are entering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
all the inhabitants fled before their approach.
The enemy now is not far away. Over there, just
against that horizon, lie the trenches they now occupy.
See this roadside along which we are driving,
how it is curiously hung with linen curtains? They
are strung on wires fifteen feet high. For miles we
ride behind them. It is the camouflage, the French
captain says, that hides us from German view. We
have just emerged from the forest at the edge of the
Mountain of Rheims when, hark! Hear it—the
sharp, distinct sound of an explosion! What is it?
Where is it? The captain lays his hand reassuringly
on my arm: “It is, I think, a tire that has
burst on the rear car.”</p>

<p>“Captain,” I say, “no automobile tire I ever heard
sounded exactly like that.”</p>

<p>“You are not nervous?” he asks. I shake my
head. “Well,” he admits, “it is sometimes that the
Germans do take a chance shot at this road.”</p>

<p>But at Rheims when we arrive, I notice that all
our automobile tires are quite intact. We enter the
city through the great bronze gate, the finishing ornaments
of which have been nicked off by German
shells. We stand in the midst of a scene of desolation
that looks like the ruins of some long ago civilisation.
Once, before this world that men had
builded began to go to pieces, even as the blocks
that children pile tumble to a nursery floor, here was
a populous busy city of some 120,000 souls. Now
our footsteps echo through deserted streets. Not a
man or woman or child is in sight. The grass is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
growing in the pavement there between the street-car
tracks. The Hotel de Ville is only a shell of a
building with the outer walls standing. This shop
is shuttered tight. The next has the entire front
gone, blown away in a bombardment. There are
empty houses from which the occupants have months
ago fled. Here stands the skeleton of a pretentious
residence, the roof gone and the front riddled: we
look directly in on the second-story room with a
dresser and a bed in disarray. There a curtain from
a deserted little front parlour flaps dismally through
a shattered window-pane almost in our faces. Here
above the cellar-grating of a house in ruins, there
arises a sickening odour. We look at each other in
questioning horror; perhaps the military with the
pick and spade assigned to disinterment duty after
some bombardment did not dig deep enough here.
But the captain does not wish to understand and
hurries us along to the next street.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">A CRUMBLING CIVILISATION</p>

<p>In the ghastly stillness of this city that was once
Rheims, at last there is a sound of life. Down the
Rue de la Paix, the street of peace, an army supply-wagon
clatters past us. And you have no idea how
pleasant can be the sound even of noise.</p>

<p>Then across the way appears a milk-woman, pushing
her cart with four tin cans and jingling a little
bell. There are a few people, it seems, still left,
employés in the champagne industry, who cling to
their homes even though they must live in the cellar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Now the devastation increases and the houses begin
to be mere rubbish heaps of brick and mortar as we
approach the Place de la Cathédrale.</p>

<p>At length we stand before the famous Cathedral
of Rheims itself. I know of no more impressive
place to be in the closing days of the year 1916 than
here at the front of the terrible world war.</p>

<p>In this edifice is symbolised all that civilisation of
ours that culminated in the Twentieth Century, now
to be razed to the ground. For lo, these seven hundred
years, even as the two great towers above us
have lifted the infinite beauty of their architectural
lace-work against the blue-domed sky, some thirty
generations of the human soul have sent their aspirations
heavenward on the incense of prayer. Over
these very stones beneath our feet, king after king
of France has walked, to receive the crown of Charlemagne
and to be anointed before this altar from “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
sainte ampouli</i>.” And now here to-day is history in
no dead and musty pages but in the making, white-hot
from the anvil of the hour! Only a little over
a mile away are the German guns that from day to
day shower the shell-fire of their destruction on the
city. This spot upon which we stand is their particular
objective point of attack. Hear! There is
a rumbling detonation. We wait hushed for an
instant. But the sound is not repeated. You see,
already there have been some 30,000 shells poured
on Rheims. Twelve hundred fell in one day only.
At any moment there may be more.</p>

<p>“If the bombardment should begin,” we had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
instructed at Maison de la Presse, “you would rush
for the nearest cellar.” I think we all have listening
ears. Every little while there is certainly repeated
that desultory firing on the front.</p>

<p>But nothing is dropping on us. And reassured,
we turn to examine the great shell hole in the pavement
not five yards distant. The Archbishop’s Palace,
immediately adjoining the church, is flat on the
ground in ruins. The cathedral itself is slowly
being wrecked. But in the public square directly
before it, look here! See Joan of Arc on her horse
triumphantly facing the future! In her hand she
is waving the bright flag of France. Amid the débris
of the great war piling up about her, the famous
statue stands absolutely untouched. Here at the
very storm centre of the attack on civilisation, with
the hell-fire of the enemy falling in a rain of thousands
of shells about her, she seems as secure, as safe
under God’s heaven as when the people passed daily
before her to prayer. Shall we not call it a miracle?</p>

<p>“See,” says the captain, his head reverently uncovered,
his eyes shining, “our Maid of Orleans.
No German shall ever harm her!” And since the
war began, it is true, no German ever has. Not a
statue of the famous girl-warrior anywhere in
France has been so much as scratched by the enemy.
Her name was the password on the day of the Battle
of the Marne and there are those who think it was
the shadowy figure of a girl on a horse that led the
troops to that victory. Oh, though cathedrals may
crumble and cities be laid waste and fields be devastated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
some time again it shall be well with the
world. For the faith of the people of France in
Joan of Arc shall never pass away.</p>

<p>That we realize, as we look on the rapt face of
the captain who leads us now within the great church
itself, where for three years all prayers have ceased.
The marvellous stained glass from the thirteenth
century, which made the religious light of the beautiful
windows, now hangs literally in tatters like
torn bed-quilts blowing in the wind. That great
jagged hole in the roof was torn by a shell at the last
bombardment. There are fissures in the side walls.
The rain comes in, and the birds. Doves light there
on the transept rail. Amid the rubbish of broken
saints with which the floor is littered, there yet stands
here and there a sorrowful statue hung with the garland
of faded flowers reminiscent of some far-off fête
day. And <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Requiescat in pace</i>, you may read the
legend cut in the stone of the eastern wall above the
tomb of some Christian Father.</p>

<p>In the nearby Rue du Cardinal de Lorraine, in a
garden saying his rosary, walks an old man in a red
cap, one of the few remaining residents who will not
leave the city. He is the venerable <abbr title="Manager">Mgr.</abbr> Lucon,
Cardinal of Rheims. Always he is praying, praying
to God to spare the cathedral. And God does not.
“I do not understand. I suppose that He in His
wisdom must have some purpose in permitting the
church to be destroyed,” says the Cardinal of Rheims.
“I do not understand,” he always adds humbly.</p>

<p>“One may not understand,” repeats the captain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
And he takes us to luncheon at the Lion d’Or, the
little inn where the wife of the proprietor still stays
to serve any “mission of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernement</i>.”
Then he shows us the famous champagne cellars of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Etablissement Pommery</i>. Here one hundred
feet below the ground, in the chalk caves built a
thousand years ago by the Romans, are twelve miles
of subterranean passageways with thirteen million
bottles of the most celebrated champagne in the
making.</p>

<p>The superintendent pours out his choicest brand:
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France</i> and the Allies,” he says, lifting his
glass. He talks more English than the captain can.
He is telling us of when the Germans entered
Rheims. “Four officers,” he says, “came riding
ahead of the army. And I met them by chance just
as they arrived in the market place of Rheims.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asks the New York correspondent
of the <cite>London Daily Mail</cite>. “I wept,” says
the Frenchman, simply and impressively. “Gentlemen,”
he adds solemnly and sadly, “I hope you may
never meet some day four conquering Chinamen riding
up Broadway.”</p>

<p>I find myself catching my breath suddenly at that.
And I am glad when the captain hums a gay little
French tune and holds out his glass a second time:
“Give us again ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France</i>.’”</p>

<p>The sun is dipping red in the west when we turn
to leave Rheims and Joan of Arc bravely flying the
French flag before its crumbling cathedral. There
is the rumble of guns once more at the front. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the winter dusk rapidly envelops the road along
which we are speeding. It is the same road to Epernay.
But now it is alive with traffic. Under the
protecting cover of the soft darkness, all sorts of
vehicles are passing. The headlights of our car flash
on a continuous procession of motor lorries, munition-wagons,
army supply-wagons, tractors, and peasants’
carts carrying produce to market. So we arrive
at Epernay for a lunch of red wine and war bread
at the little station. By ten o’clock we are safely
within the walls of Paris. We have escaped bombardment!</p>

<p>It is two days later before the French official <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i>
in the daily papers begins again recording:
“At Rheims toward six o’clock last night, after a
violent attack with trench mortars, the Germans
twice stormed our advance posts. But these two
attempts completely failed under our machine-gun
fire and grenade bombing.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">DIFFICULT DAYS IN THE WAR ZONE</p>

<p>It isn’t what happens necessarily. It’s what’s
always-going-to-happen that keeps one guessing between
life and death in a war zone. And there are
special torments of the inquisition devised for journalists.
Ordinary civilians are occupied only with
saving their lives. Journalists must save their notes.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven o’clock that night of my return
from Rheims, there is dropped in the mail box on
my hotel room door, a cablegram from America:
“Steamship <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis</em> here. Your material from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
London not on it.” The room in which I stand, the
Hotel Regina, and the city of Paris all reel unsteadily
for an instant. Has the British Government
eaten up all my journalistic findings so preciously
entrusted to Wellington House? I grasp the brass
foot rail of the bed and bring myself upstanding.
If they have, it is no time for me to lose my head.</p>

<p>Jacques with the empty coat sleeve and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix
de Guerre</i> on his breast, who operates the elevator, I
am sure thinks it a woman demented who is going
out in the streets of Paris alone at midnight. But
“an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Americaine</i>,” one can never tell what “an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Americaine</i>”
will do. “Pardon,” he says hesitatingly as
I step out, “madame knows the hour?” Yes, madame
knows the hour. But an alien may not send
a telegram without presenting a passport, the document
that never for an instant goes out of one’s personal
possession. No messenger can do this errand
for me.</p>

<p>Five minutes later I am in a taxicab tearing down
the Rue Quatre Septembre to the cable office in the
Bourse. My appeal for help to Sir Gilbert Parker
in London is being counted on the blue telegraph
blank by the operator at the little window, when suddenly
I remember I have forgotten. My hand feels
helplessly over my left hip where there is concealed
a letter of credit for three thousand dollars. But I
falter, “I haven’t any money, that is, where I can
get at it.”</p>

<p>“I have,” speaks a voice over my shoulder. I look
around into a man’s cheerful countenance. “What’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the damage?” he says again in pleasant Manhattan
English. I hesitate only for an instant. “It’s sixteen
francs I need.”</p>

<p>He promptly pulls out his bank-roll. I ask for
his card, of course, to return the loan the next day
with many thanks for his courtesy. He, however,
has no security that I will. As he puts me in my
taxicab and lifts his hat beneath the faint war-dimmed
light of the street lamps in the dark Rue
Vivienne, he only knows that I am his country-woman.
And he is an American man. The Lord
seems to send them when you need them most.</p>

<p>Three days later the awful silence in which I am
suffering all the fears there are for a journalist in
war-time, is broken by a reply from London: “Material
only delayed. Sailed steamship <em>New York</em>
instead of <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis</em>.” After another two weeks of
fitful nights in which I dream of men in khaki who
confiscate journalistic data, there comes the message
from New York that is like hearing from Heaven:
“Your consignment of material safely arrived.”
Meanwhile, before I may be permitted to take a line
out of this country, Maison de la Presse must pass
on my French data. I am feverishly editing it for
their approval when there is a knock at my door.
The maid is there with more letters than the little
brass mail box will hold. I eagerly open my American
mail to find it filled with holiday greetings. So,
it can still be Christmas somewhere in the world!
I am standing at the window with a Christmas card
in my hand, thinking pleasant thoughts of the far-away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
city called New York where there is still peace
on earth, good-will to men, when down the Rue de Rivoli
passes a motor lorry piled high with black
crosses. There are fields in France that are
planted with black crosses, acres and acres of them.
After each new push on the front, more are required,
black crosses by the cartload! I glanced at my calendar.
Why, to-day is Christmas! I had quite forgotten.
You see, over here all joy-making occasions
seem to have been such a long while ago, like the
stories of once upon a time.</p>

<p>I turn once more to the task of making ready my
data for Maison de la Presse. Here a too colourful
sentence must be rejected. There is a too flagrantly
feministic document that will be safest in the waste
basket. It is the martial mind that I must meet. A
press bureau, you see, is prepared to pass promptly
propaganda on the battles of the Somme. But dare
one risk, say, a pamphlet on the breast feeding of
infants? Propaganda about the rising value of a
baby! Dear, dear, it might, for all a man could tell,
be treason, seditious material calculated to give aid
and comfort to the enemy! Already to my inquiries
about maternity measures in Paris, have I not been
answered suspiciously: “But why do you ask?
This matter it is not of the war.”</p>

<p>My emasculated data at last are ready for review
by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le chef du service de la presse</i>. He stamps it all
over with his signature in red ink. It is done up in
packages and officially sealed in red wax with the
seal of the state of France. At the Post Office in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the Rue Etienne Marcel, I register it and mail it,
committing it with a sigh to the mercies of the great
Atlantic.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">DEALING WITH GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>Having crossed the Channel once alive, it seems
like tempting fate to try it again. I draw in my
breath as one about to plunge into a cold bath in
the morning, and go out to secure from three governments
the necessary permission that will allow me
to return to England. From the police alone it
sometimes takes eight days to secure this concession.
But at the Prefecture of Police, they read my letter
of introduction from the French consul in New York.
And I have only to leave my photograph and sign
on the dotted line. In five minutes they have given
my passport the necessary visé. The American consul
easily enough adds his. All my journey apparently
is going as pleasantly as a summer holiday
planned by a Cook’s Agency, when at length I come
up with a bump against the British Control office in
the Rue Cheveaux Lagarde. And the going away
from here requires some negotiations. The British
lieutenant in charge reads my nice French letter and
without comment tosses it aside. “You wish to go
to London?” he asks in great surprise. “Now, why
should you wish to go to London?” He gives me
distinctly to understand this is not the open season
for tourists in England. “We don’t care to have
people travelling,” he says in a tone of voice as if
that settles it. “Why have you come over here in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
these difficult and dangerous times, anyhow?” he
asks querulously and a trifle suspiciously. “The
best thing you can do is to go home directly. And
America is right across the water from here.”</p>

<p>“But, Lieutenant,” I gasp, “my trunk is in England
and I’ve got to have a few clothes.”</p>

<p>“No,” he says, “personal reasons like that don’t
interest the British Government. Neither am I able
to understand a journalistic mission which should
take a woman travelling in these days of war.” He
looks at me. “The New Position of Women! It
is not of sufficient interest to the British Government
that I should let you go,” he says with finality.</p>

<p>“I know, Lieutenant,” I agree. “But surely you
are interested in the Allies’ war propaganda for the
United States?” The light from the window shines
full on his face and I can see a faint relaxation about
the lines of his mouth. “Now I wish to go to England
so that I may tell the story of the British women’s
war work. The readers of <cite>Pictorial Review</cite> are
four million women who vote.” The lieutenant
stirs visibly. His sword rattles against the rounds
of his chair.</p>

<p>Well, my request hangs in the balance like this
for a week. At length one day he says, “I’m thinking
about letting you go. I shall have to consult
with my superior officer. I don’t at all know that he
will consent.”</p>

<p>There is the day that I have almost given up hope.
I am waiting again before the lieutenant’s desk. He
has gone for a last consultation with the superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
officer. Will he never come back? I stare at his
empty chair. The clock on the mantel ticks and
ticks. The fire in the grate snaps and snaps. Other
people at the next desk who get easier visés than
mine, come and go—a Red Cross nurse, two French
sisters of charity, a little French boy returning to
school. I have counted the pens in the lieutenant’s
glass tray. I know every blot on his desk-pad. The
clock has ticked thirty-five minutes of suspense for
me before the little French soldier in red trousers
opens the door and the lieutenant is here.</p>

<p>“Well,” he says, “we have decided. You are to
be permitted to go, but on one condition.” And he
visés my passport, “No return to France during the
period of the war.”</p>

<p>It has taken nearly two weeks to win my case.
Two days later at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, when the gardens of the
Tuileries are outlined dimly against the faint rays of
dawn, my taxicab is reeling through the streets of
Paris to the Gare <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lazare. It is noon before the
train reaches Havre. The Red Cross nurse, the London
newspaper correspondent and the Belgian air-man
all file out of our compartment and the Irish
major from Salonica is last. He turns to me with
a frank Irish smile: “Your bag can just as well go
along with my military luggage. And they’ll never
even open it.”</p>

<p>At eight o’clock that night in Havre, my passport
and the letter from the French consul in New York
are handed down the steel line of ten men at a table.
Each looks up with the same curious smile when his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
glance arrives at the last visé: “Who put that on
your passport?” asks the officer at the head of the
line. “The British Control Office?” he says with
heat. “It’s none of their business.” In an inner
room, four more men examine my documents. “Did
the British officer see this letter from the French
consul?” I am asked. I nod assent. A laugh goes
round the room. “Pardon, madame,” says the man
with the most gold braid, “the British Control Office
does not control France. You are welcome to
France, madame, welcome to France any time you
choose to come.”</p>

<p>That is the War Office that speaks. So, with the
French Government’s cordial invitation ringing
pleasantly in my ears, I go on board the Channel
boat. But I have no intention of returning to
France right away, gentlemen. I lay out my life-preserver
with a feeling of great relief that if I survive
this crossing, it will not have to be done over
again. And once more the boat in the darkness
steals safely and silently across the Channel.</p>

<p>In the morning, in Southampton, the major from
Salonica hands me his card: “Letters,” he says, a
trifle wistfully, “will always reach me at that address.”
I look at the card here before me on my
desk as I write and I wonder. The major with his
Irish smile may now be lying dead on the field of
battle somewhere on the front. In the midst of life
we are in death almost anywhere in the world to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>
<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">IN COLDEST ENGLAND</p>

<p>I have again “established my residence” with the
police in London. I feel on terms of the most intimate
acquaintance with the London police. So
many of them have my photograph and are conversant
with all the biographical and genealogical details
of my life. You have to do it, register at a police
station, every time you change your hotel. I have
moved so often, I am nervous lest I seem like a
German spy. But at the Bow Street Station, the
officer in charge just nods genially: “Oh, that’s
quite all right. Looking for more heat, aren’t you?
I know. You Americans are all alike.”</p>

<p>Have you ever shivered in London in January?
Then you don’t know what it is to be cold, not even
when the thermometer drops to zero and New York’s
all snowed in but the subway, and the street cleaning
department has to spend a million dollars to dig you
out of the drifts. Yes, I know about the Gulf
Stream. It does pleasantly moderate the outdoor
climate so that it is never really winter in England.
But the Gulf Stream does not get into their houses.
I was a luncheon guest the other day at a residence
with a crest on its note-paper. The hostess put on
a wrap to pass down the staircase from the drawing-room
to the dining-room, and with my bronchitis—all
Americans get it in London—I was simply unable
to remove my coat at all. This mansion, English
ivy-covered, and mildewed with ages of aristocracy,
has never had a real fire within its walls. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
only the tiny grate fires which are, as it were, mere
ornaments beneath the mantelpiece. The drawing-room
fire is lighted only just before the guests arrive:
the men with lifted coat-tails back up to it, their
hands crossed behind them spread to the blaze; the
dog and the cat draw near to the fender; conversation
about the fire becomes general in the tone of
voice, well, in which one might admire a rare sunset.
The dining-room fire, likewise, is lighted only just
before the butler announces luncheon. And in all
this grand mansion you discover there isn’t any place
to be warm, unless perchance the cook in the kitchen
may have it.</p>

<p>Well, English hotels strive to be as coldly correct
as this English high life. And I have suffered cold
storage in Piccadilly at the rate of ten dollars a day
as long as my bronchitis will bear it. I ought to be
ill in bed at this moment. But I can’t be. There
isn’t a hospital bed in Europe without a wounded
soldier in it. Schools, orphanages, monasteries,
country residences, castles and many hotels have
been turned into hospitals, all of them full of soldiers.
A civilian who may be ill literally has not
where to lay his head. So I set out desperately to
find heat in London. I think I have searched every
hotel from Mayfair to Bloomsbury Square. As a
special concession to American patronage a few of
them have put steam-heat on their letter heads, “central
heat,” they call it. But all European radiators,
when there are any, are as reluctant as their elevators.
“Lifts” move under groaning protest and if they go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
up, they let you know they do not expect to come
down. The radiators are equally as sullen about
radiating. They don’t want to at all. English
radiators are such toy affairs as to be incapable of
any real action. They are so small they get lost
behind the furniture. At the Hyde Park Hotel,
the clerk and I hunted all over the place: “I’m sure
we used to have them,” he said. At last our search
was rewarded. We found the one that was to keep
me warm. It was behind the dresser and such a
miniature affair, you’d surely have guessed Santa
Claus must have left it for the children at Christmas
time.</p>

<p>Some one advised me that English hotels really
didn’t do steam heat well and the best way to be
warm was to go to Brown’s, which is famous for its
grate fires. The Queen of Holland and the English
nobility always stop at Brown’s. So I tried
Brown’s. I bought all the “coals” the management
would sell at one time and tipped the maid liberally
to start the fire in my room. To maintain the
temperature anything above fifty, I had to sit by
the grate and keep putting on the coals myself. In
the bathroom there was no heat at all. “Oh, yes,
there was,” the management argued; “didn’t the hot-water
pipe for the bath come right up through the
floor?” No, they insisted, there couldn’t be any fire
in the grate in the bathroom—because there never
had been since Brown’s began. Why, probably the
hotel would burn up with so much heat as that.</p>

<p>So I moved on and on. At last I came in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Strand to the Savoy, where all Americans eventually
arrive. It is the only hotel in England with real
steam-heat. Just pull out your dresser and your
wash-stand. Concealed behind each you will discover
a radiator, warm, real, life-size! Eureka! It
is the only modern-comfort temperature in London.
I am able to remove sundry clothing accessories of
Shetland wool accumulated at Selfridge’s Department
Store in Oxford Street. And for the first time
since my arrival on these shores I am sitting in my
hotel room unwrapped in either a rose satin down
bed-quilt or a steamer-rug. My soul once more uncurls
itself for work. It is wonderful to be warm
to-day, even if one must be drowned by the Germans
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">GREATEST DRAMA IN HISTORY</p>

<p>It begins to look gravely as if one may be. Out
there in the yellow fog beyond my window, more and
more ominous are the posters that come hourly drifting
down the Strand from Fleet Street. Germany
has announced to the world that she is going to do
her worst. And she begins to tune her submarines
for the sink-on-sight frightfulness more terrible than
any that has preceded. The Dutch boats stop.
The Scandinavian boats stop. The American boats
stop. The entire ocean is now blanketed in one
danger zone.</p>

<p>All the world’s a stage of swift-moving events,
the greatest and most terrible spectacle that has ever
been put on since civilisation began. And we in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
London are spectators before a drop-curtain tight
buttoned down at the corners! It is lifted now and
then by the hand of the censor to reveal only what
the Government decides is good for the people to
see. The plain citizen in London has no means of
knowing how much it is that he does not know. It
was six months after the Battle of Ypres had occurred
before the English newspapers got around to
mention the event. So you see with what a baffling
sense of futility it is that one scans the newspapers
here now while history is making so fast that a new
page is turned every day. I am hungry for a real
live paper, bright yellow from along Park Row.
And over my breakfast coffee at the Savoy I have
only the London <cite>Times</cite>, gravely discussing by the
column, “What Is Religion?” and “The Value of
Tudor Music,” while the rest of the world is breathless
before a Russian revolution, later to be given out
in London exactly a week old.</p>

<p>But there is news that even the censor is playing
up with a lavish hand. The Strand streams with
the posters: “The United States on the Verge of
War.” My official permit from Downing Street to
go to Holland has arrived in the morning’s mail. I
cannot get there. I cannot get to Scandinavia.
Can I get home? It is the question that is agitating
a number of Americans abroad. We watchfully
wait for a warship to convoy us. But scan the Atlantic
as we may from day to day, there is none
arriving. The folks back home have a way of forgetting
that we are here. Those that do remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
are saying it serves us right. We had no business
to come in war-time. Sixteen Americans at the
Savoy every day rush to read the news bulletins that
hourly are tacked up in the lounge. But the wheels
of government at Washington move so slowly. The
Senate only debates and debates. And there is nothing
said about us! Will it be possible to flag the
attention of Congress? The same idea occurs simultaneously
to Senator Hale in Paris and to several of
us in London. This is the answer to my cabled
inquiry to Washington: “Your request the fifth.
Impracticable send warship convoy American liner
bringing Americans back from Europe. Signed,
Robert Lansing, Secretary of State.”</p>

<p>So, that’s settled. The only way for any of us to
get away from here will be just—to go. And I
begin to. There is myself to get home, and my
data. Three consignments have already gone over
under special government auspices. But there have
been anxious periods of waiting before a cable, “Stuff
safe,” has reached me. I am going to sink or swim
with the remainder of it. Wellington House arranges
with the censor at Strand House. There the
material is read and done up in packages, in each of
which is enclosed a letter with the War Office Stamp:
“Senior Aliens Officer. Port of Embarkation.
Please allow the package in which this is enclosed
to accompany bearer Mrs. M. P. Daggett as personal
luggage. This package has been examined by the
censorship.” All these data are now packed in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
suitcase that stands in my hotel room awaiting my
departure.</p>

<p>When I was caught in the homeward rush of
Americans from London in 1914, the steamship offices
in Cockspur Street were jammed to the doors.
To-day they are silent, empty, echoing places. In
1917 it is such a life and death matter to travel, that
most people don’t. So grave is the danger that the
Government refuses to permit passports at all for
English women. But for me, this that I am facing
is the risk of my trade in war-time.</p>

<p>To-day I had a letter from my New York office:</p>

<p>“The best thing for you to do is to get home as
quick as you can. Wouldn’t it be safest by way of
Spain? Any way of course is taking a chance and
a big one. I wish to the Lord you were here, safe
and sound. But there isn’t a darn thing any of us
can do about getting you back. You have either
got to take your life in your hands and take a chance
coming back, or stay in London. And God knows
when this war is going to end now!”</p>

<p>It is “safest by way of Spain.” Ambassador
Gerard getting home from Germany selected that
route. But my passport, I remember, is black-marked,
“No return to France.” And I shall have
the British Foreign Office to explain to before I can
reach my French friends who so cordially invited my
return. There will be altogether some four steel
lines to pass that way. I’d rather face the submarines.
The Spanish boats are small, only about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
4,000 tons, which would be like crossing the Atlantic
in a bathtub. I’d rather be drowned than seasick.
I think I shall make sure of comfort by a British
boat.</p>

<p>And then—the posters in the Strand begin to announce,
“Seven ships sunk to-day.” Four Dutch
boats trying for their home port, are submarined in
English waters. The <em>Laconia</em> goes down. The
Anchor liner <em>California</em> meets her fate. It’s real, I
tell you, on this side where they’re daily bringing in
the survivors. About nine hours in the open boats
is the usual experience for the rescued. Do you see
the deterring, dampening effect that this might have
on one’s enthusiasm for departure?</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">FACING LIFE OR DEATH?</p>

<p>This is the month of March. Oh, wouldn’t it be
well to wait until the water is warmer? It’s a disquieting
sensation to wake up in the night and meditate
on whether, say, a week or ten days from now,
you may find yourself at the bottom of the Atlantic.
In this state of low depression, you decide to live a
little longer. And so to-morrow you select a little
later date for your sailing. Then the arrival of
American mail proves that at least one more boat has
run the blockade and escaped the submarines.
Yours might.</p>

<p>So I take my courage in both hands, and my passport,
too, and buy my ticket. When I have done
this, a nice, quiet calm possesses me. It is as if I had
been a long time dying. Now it is over and finished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
I have nothing more to do about it. I pack
my trunk just curiously wondering, shall I ever wear
this gown again? Or shall I not? Oh, well, it is
such a relief to be going away from all this Old
World grief. Are the war clouds gathering over
New York, too? But I still can see the city all
golden in the sunlight beneath the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>Last night I was awakened at twelve o’clock by
the sounds of a gay supper party’s revelry in some
room down my corridor. Which of the staid American
gentlemen at this hotel is celebrating? Listen.
They are singing, evidently with lifted glasses:
“Hail, hail, the gang’s all here.” Not to the national
anthem could my heart thrill more than to
Tammany’s own classic refrain. New York! New
York! Not all the Kaiser’s submarines can stop
me from starting.</p>

<p>I may not send word of the steamship or the date
of my departure. But I cable my home office: “If
I do not succeed in reporting to you myself, apply for
the latest information of my movements, to the International
Franchise Club, 9 Grafton Street, London.”
You see, if I should get the last Long Assignment....</p>

<p>There are only sixteen first class passengers for
this trip on the <em>Carmania</em> in her grim grey warpaint.
Two of us are women, at whom the rest
stare with curious interest. Each of us as we step
aboard is handed a lifeboat ticket. Mine reads:
“R. M. S. <em>Carmania</em>. Name, Mrs. M. P. Daggett,
Boat No. 5.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>I think I know now how a person feels who is
going to his execution. We who walk up this steamship
gangway are under sentence of death by the
German Government. The old Latin proverb
flashes into my mind: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morituri te salutamus.</i>”
It is we who may be about to die who salute each
other here on the <em>Carmania</em> and then we are facing
the steel line. Four British officers with swords at
their sides and pistols in their belts wait for us in
the drawing-room. All the other passengers go
easily by but the New York Jewish gentleman with
the German name. At last he, too, clears. But the
British Government is not yet finished with a journalist.
The Tower of London and its damp dark
dungeons is again materialising clearly for me.</p>

<p>The lieutenant has been questioning me for half-an-hour.
“I’m sorry,” he says, “but I think I shall
have to have you searched. This suitcase of journalistic
data, you say that there is inside each package
a note stating that the material has been passed
by the Government? Why isn’t that note on the
outside of the package?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I answer earnestly. “It’s the
question I asked in vain at Strand House. The
censor said that it had to be this way. I assure
you the note is there. But if you break the outside
seal to find out, my government guarantee is gone.
And if this boat by any chance goes to Halifax, how
are they to know there that I’m not a German spy?”</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s eyes are on my face. I think
he believes I am telling the truth. “Well,” he orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
his corporal, “go to her stateroom with her and
have a look at her luggage.” The corporal is very
nice. He finds a blank note book in my trunk.
“You aren’t supposed to have this,” he says. And
there is a package of business correspondence. “Did
you tell him out there about these letters? Well,
you needn’t. And I won’t.” At the suitcase with
the magic seals he gives only one glance. To his
superior officer, when we return, the corporal reports:
“Everything’s quite all right. Stuff’s
stamped all over with the seal of the War Office.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant looks at his watch. “I had breakfast
at seven. It’s now one o’clock. That’s lunch
time.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let me detain you,” I suggest pleasantly.
He shakes his head. “I’ve got to put this job
through.”</p>

<p>I am this job. But the lieutenant has smiled.
The conversation eases up. “Pretty good suffrage
data down at the Houses of Parliament,” he himself
suggests. “Do you know, I’m almost willing now
that women should vote. I didn’t used to be. But
the war has changed my mind.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” he asked suddenly, “you’re not
mixed up with any of those militants, are you?” I
explain that I am not a suffragette, just a plain
suffragist. “Because I think those militants ought
to be shot,” he adds. I can only bite my tongue.
Has the lieutenant no sense of humour? No militant
in Holloway Jail was ever more militant than
he is with his sword and pistol at this moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>“There’s a question I’d like to ask,” he goes on.
“In your country where women have the franchise,
do you find that they all vote alike?” “No more
than all the men,” I answer. “Then that’s all
right,” he says in a relieved tone. “I’ve been afraid
that if we let women vote, they might all vote against
war.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">SHALL WE GO DOWN OR ACROSS?</p>

<p>“You really aren’t a militant, are you?” he says
again, thoughtfully. “Well, I’ll let you go.” So
that’s my last steel line.</p>

<p>The boat begins to move in the Mersey. And
the ship’s siren sounds shrilly. It is the summons
to shipwreck drill. We assemble quickly in the
lounge on the top deck, every one wearing a life-preserver.
At a second call of the siren, we file out
following the captain’s lead, to stand by our boats
in which the crew are already clambering to their
oars.</p>

<p>So now we know how for the moment of disaster.
The whole steamship waits for it. This
is a weird voyage that we begin. Mine-sweepers
out there ahead of us are cleaning up the seas. A
Scandinavian boat has just been sowing mines all
over the water. The <em>Baltic</em>, here beside us, poked
her nose out yesterday, scented danger and returned
to the river. We wait now in the Mersey twenty-four
hours before the mysterious signal is given that
it is the propitious moment for our boat to get
away. We steal softly to sea under cover of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
dense fog and a white snow-storm. The sea-gulls
are screaming shrilly above us like birds of prey.
And we who look into each other’s eyes are facing
we know not whither, it may be America or the
Farthest Country of all.</p>

<p>Three men pace the wind-swept captain’s bridge,
scanning the horizon, and there are always two clinging
in the crow’s nest in the icy gale. This boat is
manned by a pedigreed crew. From the captain to
the last cabin-boy, everybody has been torpedoed
at least once. The Marconi operator never smiles.
He sits at his instrument with a grey, drawn look
about his young boyish mouth. He was on the <em>Lusitania</em>
when she went down. He was the last man
off the <em>Laconia</em> the other day. The wrinkled suit
he’s wearing is the one they picked him up in out of
the sea.</p>

<p>For two days out, we have the little destroyers
with us, and then we are left to our luck and the
gun in front and the watching men aloft. The lifeboats
are always swung out on their davits for the
siren’s sudden call. The doors of the upper deck
stand open, waiting beside each a preparedness exhibit,
boxes of biscuit, flasks of brandy, and a pile
of blankets we are to seize as we run. We two
women have filled the pockets of our steamer-coats
with safety-pins, hairpins and a comb, first aid that
no one remembers to bring when they pick you up
from the open boat. My fellow traveller is huddling
very close to her six-foot husband, to be tucked
safely under his arm at the emergency moment. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
is good that we are having rough weather. When
the waves are tossing high, the periscopes may not
find us.</p>

<p>We are sixteen people who wander like disembodied
spirits from the gay days of old through these
great empty rooms that once rang with the joy of
hundreds of tourists on their pleasure-jaunts over
the world. There are no games. There is no dancing.
There is no band. There are no steamerchairs
on deck. At sundown we are closed in tight
behind iron shutters. No one may so much as light
a cigaret outside.</p>

<p>In the ghastly silence of the days that pass, there
is only the strain and quiver of the ship, and the
solemn boom, boom of the sea. Death is so near
that it seems fitting the glad activities of life should
cease, as when a corpse is laid out in the front room
of a house. For a while there is a tendency to
whisper, as if we were at a funeral, or as if, perchance,
the Germans in the sea could hear. But
soon we find ourselves functioning quite normally.
Not until the sixth day out, it is true, does any one
venture to take a bath. You don’t want to be rushed
like that, you know, to your drowning. But we
are sleeping regularly at night. We eat bacon and
eggs for breakfast as usual. We are pleased when
there is turkey and cranberry sauce for dinner. One
does not maintain an agony of suspense forever.
For most of us, I think it began to end when we had
committed ourselves to the decision of this voyage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
After that, the issue rests with God or with destiny,
according to one’s religion.</p>

<p>There is no attempt at dressing for dinner on the
<em>Carmania</em>. Evening dress and all the time dress is
life-preservers. We do not take them off even at
night for a while. We sleep in them. With the
new styles, of which there are many, you can. Mine
is a garment that buttons up exactly like a man’s
vest. Next to the lining is a padded filling, an Indian
vegetable matter that will keep one afloat like
cork. To-day one desires the latest modern devices
against death. A life-preserver costs anywhere from
five to fifteen dollars. You carry yours with you
as you do your toothbrush and your steamer-rug.</p>

<p>Time ticks off the minutes to life or to death to-morrow.
We walk the decks and scan a nearly deserted
ocean. Only twice do we sight a steamship
on the horizon. At table we discuss as one does
usually, oh, immortality and Christian Science and
woman suffrage. The Englishman says, “Votes for
women are really impossible, don’t you know.
Why, if the British women had voted twelve years
ago, there might not have been any battleships in
1914. And then where would England have been
to-day?”</p>

<p>“But if the German women too had voted twelve
years ago, have you thought how much happier the
world might be to-day?” I ask. The Englishman
does not see the point but the American at my left
says, “Guess you handed him one that time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>On April sixth the <em>Cunard Bulletin</em>, the wireless
newspaper, is laid beside our plates at breakfast with
the announcement that’s thrilled around a world,
“The United States has declared for war.” The
Englishman next me says, “That must be a great
relief for you.” And I cannot answer for the choking in
my throat. My country, oh, my country, too,
at the gates of hell to go in regiment by regiment!</p>

<p>On Sunday the English clergyman reads the service
including the phrases in brackets: “God save
the King (and the President of the United States).
Vanquish their enemies and preserve them in felicity.”
Down beneath the sea the Germans in their
submarines too are praying like that to the same God.
But one hopes, oh, one earnestly hopes, that God
will not hear them.</p>

<p>After the sixth day out, we have probably escaped
the submarines. The American men are no longer
kindly asking me in anxious tone, “You’re not nervous,
are you?” On the eighth day they get out the
shuffleboard. Two mornings later when we awake,
the sea is a beautiful blue, all dimpling with sparkling
points of golden light. It is real New York
sunlight again! The captain comes down from the
pilot house smiling: “Well, we got away this
time,” he says.</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty is rising on the horizon.
The Manhattan sky-line etches itself against the
heavens. Do you know, I’d rather be a door-keeper
here at Ellis Island, than a lady-in-waiting anywhere
in Europe. The <em>Carmania</em> warps into dock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in sight of the Metropolitan Tower. Was Fourteenth
Street ever cheap, common, sordid? As my
taxicab rolls across town, see how beautiful, oh, see
how beautiful is Fourteenth street, a little landscape
cross-section right out of Paradise! Nobody
here is blinded, nobody maimed, nobody in crêpe,
nobody broken-hearted—yet. I have escaped from
a nightmare of the Middle Ages. I lift my face to
the sunlight again.</p>

<p>I know I am tired, terribly tired of doing difficult
things and saving my life from day to day. But
I have not realised how near collapse I am until I
drop in a chair before the Editor’s deck in the office
of the <cite>Pictorial Review</cite>. I, who have been so crazy
to get to the country where there is still free speech,
that I had insanely hoped to stand in Broadway and
shout, have suddenly lost my voice. I can only report
in a whisper!</p>

<p>My chief looks at me in concern. “For God’s
sake, girl,” he says, “go somewhere and go to bed!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Her Country’s Call</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Thousand Women Wanted! You may
read it on a great canvas sign that stretches across
an industrial establishment in lower Manhattan.
The owner of this factory who put it there, only
knows that it is an advertisement for labour of
which he finds himself suddenly in need. But he
has all unwittingly really written a proclamation
that is a sign of the times.</p>

<p>Across the Atlantic I studied that proclamation
in Old World cities. Women Wanted! Women
Wanted! The capitals of Europe have been for
four years placarded with the sign. And now we
in America are writing it on our sky line. All over
the world see it on the street-car barns as on the
colleges. It is hung above the factories and the
coal mines, the halls of government and the farm-yards
and the arsenals and even the War Office.
Everywhere from the fireside to the firing line, country
after country has taken up the call. Now it has
become the insistent chorus of civilisation: Women
Wanted! Women Wanted!</p>

<p>But yesterday the great war was a phenomenon
to which we in America thrilled only as its percussions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
reverberated around the world. Now our own
soldiers are marching down Main Street. But their
uniforms still are new. Wait. Soon here too one
shall choke with that sob in the throat. Oh, I am
walking again in the garden of the Tuileries on a
day when I had seen war without the flags flying and
the bands playing. It was dead men and disabled
men and hospitals full and insane asylums full and
cemeteries full. “You have to remember,” said a
voice at my side, “that all freedoms since the world
began have had to be fought for. They still have
to be.”</p>

<p>So I repeat it now for you, the women of America,
resolutely to remember. And get our your Robert
Brownings! Read it over and over again,
“God’s in his heaven.” For there are going to be
days when it will seem that God has quite gone
away. Still He hasn’t. Suddenly in a lifting of
the war clouds above the blackest battle smoke, we
shall see again His face as a flashing glimpse of
some new freedom lights for an instant the darkened
heavens above the globe of the world. Already
there has been a Russian revolution which may portend
the end of a German monarchy. In England
a new democracy has buckled on the sword of a dead
aristocracy. And a great Commoner is at the helm
of state. But with all the freedoms they are winning,
there is one for which not the most decorated
general has any idea he’s fighting. I am not sure
but it is the greatest freedom of all: when woman
wins the race wins. The new democracy for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
a world has taken up arms, for the first time since
the history of civilisation began, is going to be real
democracy. There is a light that is breaking high
behind all the battle lines! Look! There on the
horizon in those letters of blood that promise of the
newest freedom of all. When it is finished—the
awful throes of this red agony in which a world is
being reborn—there is going to be a place in the Sun
for women.</p>

<p>Listen, hear the call, Women Wanted! Women
Wanted! Last Spring the Government pitched a
khaki colored tent in your town on the vacant lot
just beyond the post office, say. How many men
have enlisted there? Perhaps there are seventy-five
who have gone from the factory across the creek,
and the receiving teller at the First National Bank,
and the new principal of the High School where the
children were getting along so well, and the doctor
that everybody had because they liked him so much.</p>

<p>And, oh, last week at dinner your own husband
had but just finished carving when he looked across
the table and said: “Dear, I can’t stand it any
longer. I’m going to get into this fight to make
the world right.” You know how your face went
white and your heart for an instant stopped beating.
But what I don’t believe you do know is that you
are at this moment getting ready to play your part
in one of the most tremendous epochs of the world.
It is not only Liège and the Marne and Somme, and
Haig and Joffre and Pétain and Pershing who are
making history to-day. Keokuk, Iowa, and Kalamazoo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Mich., and Little Falls, N. Y., are too—and
you and the woman who lives next door!</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE NEW WOMAN MOVEMENT</p>

<p>Every man who enlists at that tent near the post
office is going to leave a job somewhere whether it’s
at the factory or the doctor’s office or the school
teacher’s desk, or whether it’s your husband. That
job will have to be taken by a woman. It’s what
happened in Europe. It’s what now we may see
happen here. A great many women will have a
wage envelope who never had it before. That may
mean affluence to a housefull of daughters. One,
two, three, four wage envelopes in a family where
father’s used to be the only one. You even may
have to go out to earn enough to support yourself
and the babies. Yes, I know your husband’s army
pay and the income from investments carefully accumulated
through the savings of your married life,
will help quite a little. But with the ever rising
war cost of living, it may not be enough. It hasn’t
been for thousands of homes in Europe. And eventually
you too may go to work as other women have.
It’s very strange, is it not, for you of all women who
have always believed that woman’s place was the
home. And you may even have been an “anti,”
a most earnest advocate of an ancient régime against
which whole societies and associations of what yesterday
were called “advanced” women organised
their “suffrage” protests.</p>

<p>To-day no one any longer has to believe what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
woman’s place. No woman even has anything to
say about it. Read everywhere the signs: Women
Wanted! Here in New York we are seeing shipload
after shipload of men going out to sea in khaki.
We don’t know how many boat loads like that will
go down the bay. But for an army of every million
American men in Europe, there must be mobilised
another million women to take their places behind
the lines here 3,000 miles away from the guns,
to carry on the auxiliary operations without which
the armies in the field could not exist.</p>

<p>In the department store where you shopped to-day
you noticed an elevator girl had arrived, where
the operator always before has been a boy! Outside
the window of my country house here as I write,
off on that field on the hillside a woman is working,
who never worked there before. At Lexington,
Mass., I read in my morning paper, the Rev. Christopher
Walter Collier has gone to the front in France
and his wife has been unanimously elected by the
congregation to fill the pulpit during his absence.
Sometimes women by the hundred step into new
vacancies. The Æolian Company is advertising for
women as piano salesmen and has established a special
school for their instruction. A Chicago manufacturing
plant has hung out over its employment
gate the announcement, “Man’s work, man’s pay for
all women who can qualify,” and within a week two
hundred women were at work. The Pennsylvania
railroad, which has rigidly opposed the employment
of women on its office staffs, in June, 1917, announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
a change of policy and took on in its various
departments five hundred women and girls. The
Municipal Service Commission in New York last
fall was holding its first examination to admit women
to the position of junior draughtsmen in the city’s
employ. The Civil Service Commission at Washington,
preparing to release every possible man from
government positions for war service, had compiled
a list of 10,000 women eligible for clerical work
in government departments.</p>

<p>Like that it is happening all about us. This is
the new woman movement. And you’re in it. We
all are. I know: you may never have carried a
suffrage banner or marched in a suffrage procession
or so much as addressed a suffrage campaign envelope.
But you’re “moving” to-day just the same if
you’ve only so much as rolled a Red Cross bandage
or signed a Food Administration pledge offered you
by the women’s committee of the Council of National
Defence. All the women of the world are
moving.</p>

<p>“Suffrage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la morte</i>,” a Senator on the Seine has
termed the vote offered the French feminists in the
form of a proposition that every man dying on the
field of battle may transfer his ballot to a woman
whom he shall designate. And the French women
have drawn back in horror, exclaiming: “We don’t
want a dead man’s vote. We want only our own
vote.” Nevertheless it is something like this which
is occurring.</p>

<p>And we may shudder, but we may not draw back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
It is by way of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place de la morte</i>, that women
are moving inexorably to-day into industry and commerce
and the professions, on to strange new destinies
that shall not be denied.</p>

<p>There on the firing line a bullet whizzes straight
to the mark. A man drops dead in the trenches.
Some wife’s husband, some girl’s sweetheart who before
he was a soldier was a wage earner, never will
be more. Back home another woman who had been
temporarily enrolled in the ranks of industry, steps
forward, enlisted for life in the army of labour.</p>

<p>Dear God, what a price to pay for the freedom the
feminists have asked. But this is not our woman
movement. This is His woman movement, who
moves in mysterious ways His ends to command.
We may not know. And we do not understand.
But as we watch the war clouds, we see, as it were in
the lightning flash of truth, the illuminated way
that is opening for women throughout the world.
It is westward to us that this star of opportunity has
taken its course directly from above the battlefields
of Europe.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">A WOMAN OF YESTERDAY LOOKS ON</p>

<p>Women Wanted! Women Wanted! I am
hearing it again over there. Outside the windows
of my London hotel in Piccadilly, a shaft of sharp
white light played against the blackness of the London
sky. Down these beams that searched the night
for enemy Zeppelins, a woman’s figure softly moved.
And as I looked, the close drawn curtains of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
room, it seemed, parted and she stepped lightly
across the window sill. She was gowned in a quaint,
old-time costume. “They’re not wearing them to-day,”
I smiled.</p>

<p>She looked down at her cotton gown stamped with
the broad arrows of Holloway jail. There were
women, you know, who suffered and died in that
prison garb. The way of the broad arrow used to
be the way of the cross for the woman’s cause.</p>

<p>“You ought to see the new styles,” I said. “Governments
are getting out so many new decorations for
women.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she answered. “Up in heaven we
have heard that it is so. And I have come to see.”</p>

<p>So we went out together, the Soul of a Suffragette
and I, to look on the Great Push of the new woman
movement that is swinging down the twentieth century
in sweeping battalions. It has the middle of
the road and all the gates ahead are open wide. No
ukase of parliament or king halts it. No church
dogma anathematises it. No social edict ostracises
it. The police do not arrest it and the hooligans
do not mob it. No, indeed! The applauding populace
that’s crying “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place aux dames</i>” would not
tolerate any such treatment as that. And in fact, I
don’t think there’s any one left in the world who
would want to so much as pull out a hairpin of this
triumphant processional.</p>

<p>You see, it’s so very different from the woman
movement of yesterday. That was the crusade of
the pioneers who gave their lives in the struggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
service of an unpopular ideal. Who wanted feminists
free to find themselves? Even women themselves
came haltingly as recruits. But this is a pageant,
with Everywoman crowding for place at her
country’s call. And who would not adore to be a
patriot? It is with flying colors, albeit to the solemn
measures of a Dead March that the new columns are
coming on.</p>

<p>It is the Woman Movement against which all the
parliaments of men shall never again prevail. Majestically,
with sure and rhythmic tread, it is moving,
not under its own power of propaganda, but propelled
by fearful cosmic forces. At the compulsion
of a sublime destiny accelerated under the ægis of
a war office press bureau, suffragists pro and anti
alike are gathered in. Theirs no longer to reason
why. For see, they are keeping step, always keeping
step with the armies at the front!</p>

<p>There is a new offensive on the Somme. There
is a defeat at the Yser, a victory at Verdun or Marne.
The dead men lie deep in the trenches! The war
office combs out new regiments to face the hell-fire
of shrapnel and the woman movement in all nations
joins up new recruits to fill the vacant places from
which the men, about to die, are steadily enlisted.
See the sign of the times. I point it out to My
Suffragette: “Women Wanted.” With each year
of war the demand becomes more insistent. Women
Wanted! Women Wanted!</p>

<p>“But they didn’t used to be,” she gasps in amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>And of course, I too remember when the world
was barricaded against everywhere a woman wanted
to go beyond the dishpan and the wash tub and the
nursery. It all seems now such a long while ago.</p>

<p>“Dear old-fashioned girl,” I reply, “women no
longer have to smash a way anywhere. They’ll
even be sending after you if you don’t come.”</p>

<p>When the militants of England signed with their
government the truce which abrogated for the period
of the war the Cat and Mouse Act with which they
had been pursued, it was the formal announcement
to the world of the cessation of suffrage activities
while the nations settled other issues. From Berlin
to Paris and London, feminists acquiesced in the decision
arrived at in Kingsway. It seemed indeed
that the woman’s cause was going to wait. But is
it not written: “Whoso loseth his life,” etc., “shall
find it.”</p>

<p>Women Wanted! Women Wanted! “Listen,”
I say to the Soul of a Suffragette, as we stand in the
Strand. “You hear it? And it’s like that in the
Avenue de l’Opéra and in Unter den Linden and in
Petrograd and now in Broadway. To every woman,
it is her country’s call to service.”</p>

<p>I think we may write it down in history that on
August 14, 1914, the door of the Doll’s House
opened. She who stood at the threshold where the
tides of the ages surged, waved a brave farewell to
lines of gleaming bayonets going down the street.
Then the clock on her mantel ticked off the wonderful
moment of the centuries that only God himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
had planned. The force primeval that had held
her in bondage, this it was that should set her free.
As straight as ever she went before to the altar
and the cook stove and the cradle, she stepped out
now into the wide wide world, the woman behind
the man behind the gun.</p>

<p>“See,” I say to My Suffragette, “not all the political
economists from John Stuart Mill to Ellen
Key could have accomplished it. Not even your
spectacular martyrdom was able to achieve it. But
now it is done. For lo, the password the feminists
have sought, is found. And it is Love—not logic!”</p>

<p>There are, the statisticians tell us, more than
twenty million men numbered among the embattled
hosts out there at the front where the future of the
human race is being fought for. Modern warfare
has most terrible engines of destruction. But with
all of these at command, there is not a brigade of
soldiers that could stand against their foes without
the aid of the women who in the last analysis are
holding the line.</p>

<p>Who is it that is feeding and clothing and nursing
the greatest armies of history? See that soldier in
the trenches? A woman raised the grain for the
bread, a woman is tending the flocks that provided
the meat for his rations to-day. A woman made the
boots and the uniform in which he stands. A woman
made the shells with which his gun is loaded. A
woman will nurse him when he’s wounded. A
woman’s ambulance may even pick him up on the
battlefield. A woman surgeon may perform the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
operation to save his life. And somewhere back
home a woman holds the job he had to leave behind.
There is no task to which women have not turned
to-day to carry on civilisation. For the shot that
was fired in Serbia summoned men to their most ancient
occupation—and women to every other.</p>

<p>“All the suffrage flags are furled?” questions My
Suffragette incredulously, as we pass through the
streets where once her banners waved most militantly.
“Gone with your broad arrows of yesterday,”
I affirm. “And you should see our modern
styles.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">NEW COSTUMES FOR NEW WOMEN</p>

<p>When women stood at the threshold listening
breathlessly that August day, there was one costume
ready and laid out by the nations for their wear in
every land. Coronets and shimmering ball gowns,
cap and gown in university corridors and plain little
home made dresses in rose bowered cottages were
alike exchanged for the new uniform and insignia.
And the woman who set the sign of the red cross
in the centre of her forehead appeared in her white
gown and her flowing white head dress all over
Europe as instantaneously as a new skirt ever flashed
out in the pages of a fashion magazine. To her,
every country called as naturally, as spontaneously
as a hurt child might turn to its mother. She it is
who has worn the red cross to her transfiguration in
this new Woman Movement with one of the largest
detachments in hospital service. See her on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
sinking hospital ships in the Channel or the Dardanelles,
insisting on “wounded soldiers first” as she
passes her charges to safety, and waiting behind herself
goes quietly under the water. And with bandaged
eyes she has even walked unflinchingly to
death before the levelled guns of the enemy soldiery,
as did Edith Cavell in Belgium who went with her
red cross to immortality. All the world has been
breathless before the figure of the woman who dies
to-day for her country like a soldier. No one knew
that the Red Cross would be carried to these heights
of Calvary. But from the day that the great slaughter
began, it was accepted as a matter of course that
woman’s place was going to be at the bedside of the
wounded soldier. Even as the troops buckled on
sword and pistol and the departing regiments began
to move, it was made sure that she should be waiting
for them on their return.</p>

<p>In Germany in the first month of the war, no less
than 70,000 women of the Vaterlandischer Frauenverein,
trained in first aid to the injured, had arrived
at the doors of the Reichstag to offer themselves for
Red Cross service.</p>

<p>I remember in the spring of 1914 to have stood
at Cecilienhaus in Charlottenburg. Cecilienhaus
with its crèche and its maternity care and its folks
kitchens and its workingmen’s gardens, was devoted
to the welfare work in which the Vaterlandischer
Frauenverein of the nation was engaged. Frau
Oberin Hanna Kruger showed me with pride all
these social activities. Then she looked away down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the Berliner Strasse and said: “But when war
comes—” Had I heard aright? That you know
was in May, 1914. But she repeated: “When
war comes we are going to be able to take care of
seventy-five soldiers in this dining-room and in that
maternity ward we shall be able to have beds for
a dozen officers.” All over Germany the half million
women of the Vaterlandischer Frauenverein
planning like that, “when war comes,” had taken a
first aid nurse’s training course. They were as ready
for mobilisation as were their men. France, viewing
with alarm these preparations across the border,
had her women also in training. The Association
des Dames Français, the Union des Femmes de
France and the Société Secours aux Blessés Militaires,
at once put on the Red Cross uniform and
brought to their country’s service 59,500 nurses. In
England the Voluntary Aid Detachments of the Red
Cross had 60,000 members ready to serve under the
3,000 trained nurses who were registered for duty
within a fortnight of the outbreak of war. Similarly
every country engaged in the conflict, taking
inventory of its resources, eagerly accepted the services
of the war nurse. The same policy of state
actuated every nation as was expressed by the Italian
Minister of War who announced: “By utilising
the services of women to replace men in the military
hospitals, we shall release 20,000 soldiers for active
duty at the front.”</p>

<p>The Red Cross of service to the soldier is the most
conspicuous decoration worn by women in all warring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
countries. Everywhere you meet the nurses’
uniform almost as universally adopted a garb as was
the shirt waist of yesterday. We are here at Charing
Cross station where nightly under cover of the
soft darkness the procession of grim grey motor ambulances
rolls out bearing the wounded. They are
coming like this too at the Gare du Nord in Paris,
at the Potsdam station in Berlin, and up in Petrograd.
In each ambulance between the tiers of
stretchers on which the soldiers lie, you may see the
figure of a woman silhouetted faintly against the dim
light of the railroad station as she bends to smooth
a pillow, to adjust a bandage, or now to light a cigarette
for a maimed man who never can do that least
service for himself again. She may be a peeress of
the realm, or she may be a militant on parole granted
the amnesty of her government that needs her more
these days for saving life than for serving jail sentence.
But look, and you shall see the Red Cross
on her forehead!</p>

<p>The grey ambulances like this coming from the
railroad stations long ago in every land filled up the
regular military hospitals through which the patients
are passed by the thousands every month. And
other women taking the Red Cross set it above the
doorways of historic mansions opened to receive the
wounded. In Italy, Queen Margherita and Queen
Elena gave their royal residences. In Paris Baroness
Rothschild has made her beautiful house with
its great garden behind a high yellow wall a Hôpital
Militaire Auxiliaire. And many private residences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
like this are among the eight hundred hospitals in
France which are being operated under the direction
of one woman’s organisation alone, the Société
de Secours aux Blessés Militaires.</p>

<p class="caption center">MRS. H. J. TENNANT<br />

government councils.</p>
</div>

<p>Here in London, in Piccadilly, at Devonshire
House, desks and filing cabinets fill the rooms once
gay with social functions. And hospital messengers
go and come up and down the marvellous gold and
crystal staircase. The Duchess of Devonshire has
turned over the great mansion as the official headquarters
for the Red Cross. Nearby, in Mayfair,
Madame Moravieff, whose husband is connected with
the Russian diplomatic service, is serving as commandant
for the hospital she has opened for English
soldiers. Lady Londonderry’s house in Park Lane
is a hospital. By the end of the first year of war,
like this, no less than 850 private residences in England
had been transformed into Voluntary Aid Detachment
Red Cross Hospitals.</p>

<p>In hospital financiering the American woman in
Europe has led all the rest. Margaret Cox Benet,
the wife of Lawrence V. Benet in Paris, braved the
perils of the Atlantic crossing to appeal to America
for contributions to the American Ambulance Hospital
at Neuilly. It is equalled by only one other
war hospital in Europe, the splendidly equipped
hospital of the American women at Paignton, England,
initiated by Lady Arthur Paget, formerly
Mary Paran Stevens of New York. Lady Paget,
who is president of the American Women’s War
Relief Fund, has just rounded out the first million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
dollars of the fund which she has personally raised
for war work.</p>

<p>You see how these also serve who are doing the
executive and organisation work that makes it possible
for the woman in the front lines to wear her red
cross even to her transfiguration. Accelerated by
the activities of women like these behind the lines,
the Red Cross battalions are leading the Great Push
of the new woman movement. The woman in the
nurse’s uniform is not exciting the most comment,
however. It is by reason of her numbers, the thousands
and thousands of her that she commands the
most attention. But she was really expected.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WHERE YOU FIND THE MILITANTS TO-DAY</p>

<p>For the amazing figure that has emerged by magic
directly out of the battle smoke of this war, see the
woman in khaki! Khaki, I explain to My Suffragette,
is one of the most popular of government
offerings for women’s wear. The material has been
found most serviceable in a war zone either to die
in or to live in, while you save others from dying.
It is sometimes varied with woollen cloth preferred
for warmth. But the essential features of the costume
are preserved: the short skirt, the leather leggings,
the military hat and the shoulder straps with
the insignia of special service. When governments
have called for unusual duty that is difficult or disagreeable
or dangerous, it is the woman in khaki who
responds: “Take me. I am here.” She will, in
fact, do anything that there’s no one else to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<p>Stick-at-nothings, the London newspapers have
nicknamed the women’s Reserve Ambulance Corps
of 400 women who wear a khaki uniform with a
green cross armlet. With white tunics over these
khaki suits, a detachment of green cross girls at Peel
House, the soldiers’ club in Westminster, does house-maid
duty from seven in the morning until eight at
night. They are making beds and waiting on table,
these young women, who, many of them, in stately
English homes have all their lives been served by
butlers and footmen. I saw a Green Cross girl at
the military headquarters of the corps in Piccadilly
making to Commandant Mabel Beatty her report of
another phase of war work. She was such a young
thing, I should say perhaps eighteen, and delicately
bred. I know I noticed the slender aristocratic hand
that she lifted to her hat in salute to her superior
officer: “I have,” she said, “this morning burned
three amputated arms, two legs and a section of a
jaw bone. And I have carried my end of five heavy
coffins to the dead wagon.” That’s all in her day’s
work. She’s a hospital orderly. And it’s one of
the things an orderly is for, to dispose of the by-products
of a great war hospital.</p>

<p>See also, these ambulances that bring the wounded
from Charing Cross. They are “manned” by a
woman outside as well as the nurse within. There
is a girl at the wheel in the driver’s seat. The Motor
Transport Section of the Green Cross Society
accomplishes an average weekly mileage of 2,000
miles transporting wounded and munitions. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
this they respond for any service to which the exigencies
of war may call. There was the time of the
first serious Zeppelin raid on London when amid
the crash of falling bombs and the horror of fire
flaming suddenly in the darkness, the shrieks of the
maimed and dying filled the night with terror and
the populace seemed to stand frozen to inaction at
the scene about them. Right up to the centre of
the worst carnage rolled a Green Cross ambulance
from which leaped out eight khaki clad women.
They were, mind you, women of the carefully sheltered
class, who sit in dinner gowns under soft candle
light in beautifully appointed English houses.
And they never before in all their lives had witnessed
an evil sight. But they set to work promptly
by the side of the police to pick up the dead and the
dying, putting the highway to order as calmly as
they might have gone about adjusting the curtains
and the pillows to set a drawing-room to rights.
“Thanks,” said the police, when sometime later an
ambulance arrived from the nearest headquarters,
“the ladies have done this job.” Since then the
Woman’s Reserve Ambulance Corps is officially attached
to the “D” Division of the Metropolitan Police
for air raid relief.</p>

<p>That girl in khaki who is serving as a hospital
orderly, you notice, wears shoulder straps of blue.
She comes from the great military hospital in High
Holborn that is staffed entirely by women. We
may walk through the wards there where we shall
see many of her. Above her in authority are women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
with shoulder straps of red. These are they who
wear the surgeon’s white tunic in the operating theatre,
who issue the physician’s orders at the patient’s
bedside. Now the door at the end of the ward
opens. A woman with red shoulder straps stands
there, whom every wounded patient able to lift his
right arm, salutes as if his own military commander
had appeared. “But it’s my doctor, my doctor,”
exclaims the Suffragette of yesterday.</p>

<p>And it is. The doctor, you see, used to hold in
fact the unofficial post of first aid physician to the
Women’s Social and Political Union. Frequently
she was wont to hurry out on an emergency call to
attend some militant picked up cut and bleeding
from the missiles of the mobs or released faint and
dying from a hunger strike. And the doctor herself
did her bit in the old days. The Government
had her in Holloway jail for six weeks. Well, to-day
they have her as surgeon in command of this
war hospital with the rank of major. She’s so well
fitted for the place, you see, by her earlier experience.</p>

<p>But, visibly agitated, My Suffragette again plucks
at my sleeve: “Are you quite sure,” she asks, “that
Scotland Yard won’t take her?”</p>

<p>Poor dear lady of yesterday. They’re not doing
that to-day. Your woman movement was militant
against the Government. This woman movement is
militant with the Government. There’s all the difference
in the world. And the woman in khaki has
found it. Militancy of the popular kind has come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to be most exalted in woman. Besides a woman doctor
is too valuable in these days to be interfered with.
She is no longer sent as a missionary physician to
the heathen or limited to a practice exclusively
among women and children. She is good enough
for anywhere. One issue of the <cite>Lancet</cite> advertises:
“Women doctors wanted for forty municipal appointments.”
Women doctors wanted, is the call
of every country. This military hospital in London
of which Dr. Louisa Garrett Anderson, major, is in
command, is entirely staffed with women. Paris
has its war hospital with Dr. Nicole Gerard-Mangin,
major in command. Dr. Clelia Lollini, sub-lieutenant,
is operating surgeon at a war hospital in
Venice. In Russia one of the most celebrated war
doctors is the Princess Gurdrovitz, surgeon in charge
of the Imperial Hospital at Tsarkoe Selo.</p>

<p>Oh, the khaki costume I think we may say is admired
of every war office. It has found a vogue
among all the allies. It has appeared the past year
in America, where it has been most recently adopted.
But the model for whom it was particularly made to
measure was the militant suffragette of England.
Nearly everybody who used to be in Holloway jail is
wearing it. It’s the best fit that any of them find to-day
in the shop windows of government styles. And
it’s so well adapted to women to whom all early Victorian
qualities are as foreign as hoop skirts. You
would not expect one inured to hardship by alternate
periods of starvation and forcible feeding to be either
a fearsome or a delicate creature. And the courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
that could horsewhip a prime minister or set off a
bomb beneath a bishop’s chair, is just the kind that
every nation’s calling for in these strenuous times.
It’s the kind that up close to the firing line gets mentioned
in army orders and decorated with all crosses
of iron and gold and silver.</p>

<p>You will find the woman who has put on khaki at
the front in all the warring countries. The Duchess
of Aosta is doing ambulance work in Italy. The
Countess Elizabeth Shouvaleff of Petrograd commanded
her own hospital train that brought in the
wounded. But it is the British woman in khaki who
has gone farthest afield. The National Union’s
“Scottish Women’s Hospitals,” as they are known,
are right behind the armies. Staffed from the surgeons
to the ambulance corps entirely by women,
they go out to any part of the war zone where the
need is greatest.</p>

<p>See the latest “unit” that is leaving Paddington
Station. The equipment they are taking with them
includes every appliance that will be required, from
a bed to a bandage, and numbers just 1,051 bales
and cases of freight. The entire unit, forty-five
women, have had their hair cut short. For sanitary
reasons, is the euphemistic way of explaining it.
For protection against the vermin with which patients
from the trenches will be infested, if you ask
for war facts as they are. Units like this have gone
out to settle wherever by army orders a place has
been made for them, in a deserted monastery in
France that they must first scrub and clean, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
refugee barracks in Russia, in a tent in Serbia where
they themselves must dig the drainage trenches.</p>

<p>Their surgeons have stood at the operating table
a week at a stretch with only an hour or two of sleep
each night. Their doctors have battled with epidemics
of typhoid and plague. Their ambulance
girls have brought in the wounded from the battlefield
under shell-fire. Hospitals have been conducted
under bombardment with all the patients
carried to the cellar. Hospitals have been captured
by the enemy. Hospitals have been evacuated at
command with the patients loaded on trains or motor
cars or bullock wagons for retreat with the army.
There were forty-six British women who shared in
the historic retreat of the Serbian army three hundred
miles over the Plain of Kossovo and the mountains
of Albania. Men and cattle perished by the
score. But the women doctors, freezing, starving,
sleeping in the fields, struggling against a blinding
blizzard with an amazing physical endurance and a
dauntless courage, all came through to Scutari. Out
on the far-flung frontiers of civilisation, the woman
in khaki who has done these things is memorialised.
At Mladanovatz, the Serbians have erected a fountain
with the inscription: “In memory of the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals and their founder, Dr. Elsie
Inglis.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">SUFFRAGISTS LED ALL THE REST</p>

<p>When the great call, “Women wanted,” first commenced
in all lands, there were those who stood with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
reluctant feet at the threshold simply because they
did not know how to step out into the new wide
world of opportunity stretching before them. In
this crisis it was to the suffragists that every government
turned. Who else should organise? These
women, like My Suffragette, had devoted their lives
to assembling cohorts for a cause! The Assoziazione
per la Donna in Italy, as the Conseil National des
Femmes Françaises in France, promptly responded
by offering their office machinery as registration bureaus
through which women could be drafted into
service. It was the suffrage association at Budapest,
Hungary, that filled the order from the city
government for five hundred women street sweepers.
The Vaterlandischer Frauenverein assembled 25,000
women in Berlin alone to take the course of training
arranged for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">helferinnen</i>, assistants in all phases of
relief work. But it was in England where the
woman movement of yesterday had reached its highest
point in organisation that the woman movement
for to-day was best equipped to start. Britain
counted among the nation’s resources no less than
fifty separate suffrage organisations, one of which
alone, the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies,
was able to send out its instructions to over
500 branches! And the mobilisation of the woman
power of a nation was under way on a scale that
could have been witnessed in no other era of the
world.</p>

<p>The woman who has been enlisted in largest numbers
in England as in other lands is the woman who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
at her country’s call hung up the housewife’s kitchen
apron in plain little cottages to put on a new uniform
with a distinctive feature that has been hitherto
conspicuously missing from women’s clothes. It has
a pocket for a pay envelope. “See,” I say to My
Suffragette, “you would not know her at all, now,
would you?”</p>

<p>She came marching through the streets of London
on July 17, 1915, in one of the most significant
detachments mustered for the new woman movement,
40,000 women carrying banners with the new
device: “For men must fight and women must
work.” And industry, in which she was enlisting,
presented her with a new costume. The Ministry
of Munitions in London got out the pattern. Employers
of labour throughout the world are now
copying it. There isn’t anything in the chorus
more attractive than the woman who’s walked into
the centre of the stage in shop and factory wearing
overall trousers, tunic and cap. Some English factories
have the entire woman force thus uniformed
and others have adopted only the tunic. Here are
girl window cleaners with pail and ladder coming
down the Strand wearing the khaki trousers. The
girl conductor of the omnibus that’s just passed has
a very short skirt that just meets at the knees her
high leather leggings. The girl lift operators at the
stores in Oxford Street are in smart peg-top trousers.
In Germany the innovation is of course being done
by imperial decree, a government order having put
all the railway women in dark grey, wide trousers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
In France the new design is accepted slowly. The
girl conductor who swings at the open door of the
Paris Metro with a whistle at her lips, wears the
men employé’s cap but she still clings to her own
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tablier</i>.”</p>

<p>That July London procession organised by the
suffragists, led in fact by Mrs. Pankhurst herself, in
response to labour’s call, “Women wanted,” is the
last suffrage procession of which the world has heard.
And it is the most important feminist parade that
has ever appeared in any city of the world. For it
was a procession marching straight for the goal of
economic independence. It was the vanguard of
the moving procession of women that in every country
is still continuously passing into industry. Germany
in the first year of war had a half million
women in one occupation alone, that of making
munitions. France has 400,000 “munitionettes.”
Great Britain in 1916 had a million women who had
enlisted for the places of men since the war began.
In every one of Europe’s warring countries and now
in America, women are being rushed as rapidly as
possible into commerce and industry to release men.
In Germany nearly all the bank clerks are women.
The Bank of France alone in Paris has 700 women
clerks. In England women clerks number over
100,000. And the British Government is steadily
advertising: Wanted, 30,000 women a week to replace
men for the armies.</p>

<p>“Who works, fights,” Lloyd George has said, in
the English Parliament. English women enlisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
for agriculture have been given a government certificate
attesting: “Every woman who helps in agriculture
during the war is as truly serving her country
as is the man who is fighting in trenches or on the
sea.”</p>

<p>“But,” protests the bewildered woman from only
the other day, “they told us that women didn’t
know enough to do man’s work, that she wasn’t
strong enough for much of anything beyond light
domestic duty like washing and scrubbing and cooking
and raising a family of six or eight or ten children.”</p>

<p>“Nothing that anybody ever said about women
before August, 1914,” I answer, “goes to-day. All
the discoveries the scientists thought they had made
about her, all the reports the sociologists solemnly
filed over her, all the limitations the educators laid
on her and all the jokes the punsters wrote about
her—everything has gone to the scrap-heap as repudiated
as the one-time theory that the earth was
square instead of round. Everything they said she
wasn’t and she couldn’t and she didn’t, she now is
and she can and she does.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">IT IS UNIVERSAL SERVICE</p>

<p>Even women who do not need to work for pay
are working without it and adding to the demonstration
of what women can do. See the colonel’s lady
taking the place of Julie O’Grady at the lathe for
week-end work in the munition factories to release
the regular worker for one day’s rest in seven. Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Lawrence in a white tunic and wearing a diamond
wrist watch is in charge of the canteen at the Woolwich
Arsenal, supervising the serving of kippers and
toast at the tea hour for the 2,000 women employés.
Lady Sybil Grant, Lord Rosebery’s daughter, is the
official photographer to the Royal Naval Air Service
at Roehampton. The Countess of Limerick, assisted
by fifty women of title, among them Lady
Randolph Churchill, is running the Soldiers’ Free
Refreshment Buffet at the London Bridge Station.
The Marchioness of Londonderry, directing the Military
Cookery Section of the Women’s Legion, has
given to her nation the woman army cook who has
recently replaced 5,000 men. Women of world-wide
fame have cheerfully turned to the task that
called. Beatrice Harraden, celebrated author of
“Ships That Pass in the Night,” is in the uniform
of an orderly at the Endell Street War Hospital,
where she has done a unique service in organising
the first hospital library for the patients. May Sinclair,
whose recent book, “The Three Sisters,” is one
of the great contributions to feminist literature, is
enrolled as a worker at the Kensington War Hospital
Supply Department. She has invented the machine
used there to turn out “swabs” seven times
faster than formerly they were made by hand.</p>

<p>There is the greatest diversity in war service.
One of the first calls answered by the suffragists was
for an emergency gang of 300 women from the
metropolis to supervise the baling of hay for the
army. Lloyd George has been supplied with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
woman secretary and a woman chauffeur, the latter
a girl who was a celebrated hunger striker before the
war. In the royal dockyards and naval establishments
there are 7,000 women employed. Through
the Woman’s National Land Service Corps 5,000
university and other women of education have been
recruited to serve as forewomen of detachments of
women farm labourers. The army last spring was
asking for 6,000 women at the War Office to assist
in connection with the work of the Royal Flying
Corps. Oh, the list of what women are doing to-day
is as indefinitely long as everything that there is to
be done.</p>

<p>And the woman movement sweeps on directly
toward the gates of government. See the woman
war councillor who recently arrived in 1916. She
came into view first in Germany, where Frau Kommerzienrat
Hedwig Heyl of Berlin is a figure almost
as important as is the Imperial Chancellor. The
daughter of the founder of the North German Lloyd
Line, herself the president of the Berlin Lyceum
Club and the manager of the Heyl Chemical Works,
in which she succeeded her late husband as president,
Frau Heyl knows something of organisation.
And she it is who has been responsible more than
any other of the Kaiser’s advisers for the conservation
of the food supply which keeps the German
armies strong against a world of its opponents. The
second day after war was declared, in conference
with the Minister of the Interior, she had formulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the plan that by night the Government had telegraphed
to every part of Germany: there was formed
the Nationaler Frauendien to control all of the activities
of women during the war. She was placed at
the head of the Central Commission. It was the
Nationaler Frauendien that made the suggestions
which the Government adopted for the conservation
of the food supply. And it was they who were entrusted
with organising the food supplies of the
nation and educating the women in their use to the
point of highest efficiency. As a personal contribution
to this end, Frau Heyl has published a War
Cook Book, arranged an exhibit of substitute foods
for war use, and has turned one section of her chemical
works into a food factory from which she supplies
the government with 6,000 pounds of tinned
meat a day for the army.</p>

<p>After all, who are the real food controllers of a
nation? Could a minister of finance, for instance,
bring up a family on, say, 20 shillings a week? Yet
there were women in every nation doing that before
they achieved fame on the firing line and in the
making of munitions. Last spring, as the food
question became a gravely determining factor in the
war, it began to be more and more apparent that the
feminine mind trained to think in terms of domestic
economy, might have something of value to contribute
to questions of state. Why let Germany
monopolise this particular form of efficiency? And
England in 1917 called to its Ministry of Food two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
women, Mrs. Pember Reeves, one of its radical suffragists,
and Mrs. C. S. Peel, the editor of a woman’s
magazine and a cook book.</p>

<p>About the same time each of the warring nations
decided that the mobilised women forces everywhere
could be most efficiently directed by women. Germany
appointed as an attaché for each of the six
army commands throughout the empire a woman
who is to serve as “Directress of the Division for
Women’s Service.” From Dr. Alice Salomon in
the Berlin-Potsdam district to Fraulein Dr. Gertrude
Wolf in the Bavarian War Bureau, each of
these new appointees is a feminist leader from that
woman movement of yesterday. In France the enrolment
of French women is under the direction of
<abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Emile Boutroux and <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Emile Borel. In
England the highest appointment for a woman since
the war is the calling of Mrs. H. J. Tennant, the
prominent suffragist, to be Director of the Woman’s
Department of National Service. America, preparing
to enter the great conflict in the spring of 1917,
at the very outset organised a Woman’s Division of
the National Defence Council and called to its command
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, the great suffrage
leader.</p>

<p>It’s a long way back to the Doll’s House, isn’t it,
with woman’s place to-day in the workshop and the
factory, the war hospital, the war zone and the war
office? And now they are calling women to the
electorate. Russia has spoken, England has spoken.
America is making ready. Doesn’t Mr. Kipling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
want to revise his verses: “When man gathers with
his fellow braves for council, he does not have a place
for her”?</p>

<p>It really has ceased to be necessary for woman any
longer to plead her cause. Every government’s doing
it for her. The woman movement now is both
called and chosen. And the British Government is
the most active feminist advocate of all. The greatest
brief for the woman’s cause that ever was arranged
is a handsome volume on “Women’s War
Work,” issued by the British War Office, as a guide
to employers of labour throughout the United Kingdom.
This famous publication lists exactly ninety-six
trades and 1,701 jobs which the Government says
women can do just as well as men, some of them
even better. A second publication issued in London
with the approval of the War Office, sets forth in
more literary form “Women’s Work in Wartime,”
and is dedicated to “The Women of the Empire,
God save them every one.”</p>

<p>It was in 1916 that I talked with a German gentleman
who is near enough to the Kaiser to voice
the point of view from that part of the world.
“Women from now on are going to have a more important
place in civilisation than they ever have held
before,” affirmed Count von Bernstorff as we sat in
his official suite at the Ritz Hotel in New York.
“In the ultimate analysis,” he spoke slowly and impressively,
“in the ultimate analysis,” he repeated,
“it is the nation with the best women that’s going to
win this war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know what I think?” says the Soul of
a Suffragette as we stand before the Great Push.
“I think that whoever else wins this war, woman
wins.”</p>

<p>Her country’s call? Listen: there is a higher
overtone—her man’s call. Is it not the woman behind
the man behind the gun who has achieved her
apotheosis?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Women Who Wear War Jewelry</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a new kind of jewelry that will be coming
out soon. We shall see it probably this season
or at least within the next few months. It will take
precedence of all college fraternity pins and suffrage
buttons and society insignia and even of the costliest
jewels. For it will be unique. Since no American
woman has ever before worn it.</p>

<p>As a <em>Mayflower</em> descendant or a Colonial Dame or
a Daughter of the Revolution, you may have proudly
pinned on the front of your dress the badge that
establishes your title perhaps to heroic ancestry. In
the gilt cabinet in the front parlour you may even
cherish among curios of the wide, wide world a
medal of honour as your choicest family heirloom.
Who was it who won it, grandfather or great-grandfather
or great-great-grandfather? Anyway, it was
that soldier lad of brave uniformed figure whose
photograph you will find in the old album that disappeared
from the centre-table something like a generation
ago. We are getting them out from the
attics now, the dusty, musty albums, and turning
their pages reverently to look into the pictured eyes
of the long ago. Some one who still recalls it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
tell us again this soldier-boy’s story. Somewhere he
did a deed of daring. Somehow he risked his life for
his country. And a grateful government gave him
this, his badge of courage. It’s fine to have in the
family, there in the parlour cabinet. You are proud,
are you not, to be of a brave man’s race? But blood,
they say, will always tell. Heroism and daring may
be pulsing in your veins to-day as once in his.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought how it might be to have
your own badge of courage? Ah, yes, even though
you are a woman. No, it is true, there are no such
decorations that have been handed down from grandmother
or great-grandmother or great-great-grandmother.
It is not that they did not deserve them.
But their deeds were done too far behind the front
for that recognition. To-day, as it happens, the new
woman movement has advanced right up to the
firing line, and it’s different. Every nation fighting
over in Europe is bestowing honours of war on
women. There is no reason to doubt that special
acts of gallantry and service on the part of American
women now in action with the hospitals and relief
agencies that have accompanied our troops abroad,
shall be similarly recognised by the War Department.
To earn a decoration, you see—not merely
to inherit one—that can be done to-day.</p>

<p>She was the first war heroine I had ever seen,
Eleanor Warrender. Over in London I gazed at
her with bated breath—and to my surprise and astonishment
found her just like other women.</p>

<p>Among those called to the colours in England in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
1914, she is one of the specially distinguished who
have followed the battle flags to within sight of the
trenches, within sound of the guns. And, somehow,
one will inadvertently think of these as some sort of
super-woman. Before this there have been those
who did what they could for their men under arms.
There was one woman who risked her life heroically
for British soldiers. And Florence Nightingale’s
statue has been set along with those of great men in
a London public square. In this war many women
are risking their lives. They are receiving all the
crosses of iron and silver and gold. And to the lady
of the decoration who wears this war jewelry, it is a
souvenir of sights such as women’s eyes have seldom
or never looked on before since the world began.</p>

<p>I have said that Eleanor Warrender seemed to me
just like other women. And she is at first; other
war heroines are. Until you catch the expression
in their eyes, which affords you suddenly, swiftly,
the fleeting glimpse of the soul of a woman who
knows. There is that about all real experience that
does not fail to leave its mark. You may get it in
the quality of the voice, in a chance gesture that is
merely the sweep of the hand, or in the subtle emanation
of the personality that we call atmosphere.
But wherever else it may register, there are unveiled
moments when you may read it in the eyes of these
women who know—that they have seen such agony
and suffering and horror as have only been approximated
before in imaginative writing. The ancient
pagans mentioned in their books that have come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
down to us, a place they called Hades, where everything
conceivable that was frightful and awful
should happen. The Christians called it Hell.</p>

<p>But nobody had been there. And there were
those in very modern days who said in their superior
wisdom that it could not be, that it did not exist.
Now how are we all confounded! For it is here
and now. The Lady with the Decoration has seen
it. Look, I say, in her eyes.</p>

<p>For that is where you will find out. She does not
talk of what she has been through.</p>

<p>“My friend Eleanor Warrender,” Lady Randolph
Churchill told me, “has been under shell-fire for
three years, nursing at hospitals all along the front
from Furnes to the Vosges Mountains. Sometimes
she has spent days with her wounded in dark cellars
where they had to take refuge from the bombs that
came like hail—and the cellars were infested with
rats.”</p>

<p>Eleanor Warrender, when I saw her, came into the
Ladies’ Empire Club at 67 Grosvenor Street, London.</p>

<p>High-bred, tall, and slender, she wore the severe
tailor-made suit in which you expect an Englishwoman
to be attired. In the buttonhole of her left
coat lapel there was a dark silk ribbon striped in a
contrasting colour from which hung a small bronze
Maltese cross. It is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i> bestowed
on her by the French Government for “conspicuous
bravery and gallant service at the front.” She
dropped easily on a chintz-covered lounge before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
grate fire in the smoking-room. A club-member
caught sight of the ribbon in the coat lapel. “I say,
Eleanor,” she said eagerly, coming over to examine
it.</p>

<p>Miss Warrender was home on leave. In a few
days she would be returning again to her unit in
France. She has been living where one does not get
a bath every day and there are not always clean
sheets. One sleeps on the floor if necessary, and
what water there is available sometimes must be
carefully saved for dying men to drink. The Red
Cross flag that floats over the hospital is of no protection
whatever. Sometimes it seems only a menace,
as if it were a sign to indicate to the enemy
where they may drop bombs on the most helpless.</p>

<p>There is a slight soft patter at the window-pane
and it isn’t rain. It’s shrapnel. The warning
whistle has just sounded. There is the cry in the
streets—“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardez vous!</i>” The taubes are here. A
Zeppelin bomb explodes on contact, so you seek
safety in the cellar, which it may not reach. But a
taube bomb, small and pointed, pierces a floor and
explodes at the lowest level reached. So you may
not flee from a taube bomb to anywhere. You just
stay with your wounded and wait. Ah, there is the
explosion which makes the cots here in the ward rock
and the men shake as with palsy and turn pale.
But, thank God, this time the explosion is outside
and in the garden. Beyond the window there, what
was a flower-bed three minutes ago is an upturned
heap of earth and stone. They are bringing in now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
four more patients for whom room must be made
besides these from the battlefield that have been
operated on, twenty of them, since nine o’clock this
morning. These four who are now being laid tenderly
on the white cots have two of them had their
legs blown off, and two others are already dying from
wounds more mortal.</p>

<p>Eleanor Warrender a little later closes their eyes
in the last sleep. She has watched beside hundreds
of men like that as they have gone out into the
Great Beyond. And just now she walks into the
Ladies’ Empire Club as calmly as if she had but
come from a shopping tour in Oxford Street. Ah,
well, but one can suffer just so much, as on a musical
instrument you may strike the highest key and you
may strike it again and again until it flats a little
on the ear because you have become so accustomed
to it. But it is the limit. It is the highest key.
There is nothing more beyond, at least. And that is
what you feel ultimately about these women who
have come through the experience that leads to the
decoration. It is one in the most constant danger
who arrives at length at the most constant calm.</p>

</div>

<p>“I don’t know really why it should be called bravery,”
says Eleanor Warrender’s quiet voice. “You
see, a bomb has never dropped on me, so I have no
actual personal experience of what it would be like.
Now in that old convent in Flanders turned into a
hospital, Sister Gertrude at the third cot from where
I stood had a leg blown off, and Sister Felice had lost
an arm, and I think it was very brave of them to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>right on nursing in the danger zone afterward. But
I—as I have said—no bomb has ever hit me. And
having no experience of what the sensation would be
like, it isn’t particularly brave of me to go about my
business without special attention to a danger of
which I have no experience of pain to remember.
As for death,” and Eleanor Warrender looked out
in Grosvenor Street into the yellow grey London
fog, “as for death, it is, after all, only an episode.
And what does it matter whether one is here or
there?”</p>

<p>Eleanor Warrender and others have gone out into
the great experience on the borderland with death
from quiet and uneventful lives of peace such as
ours in America up to the present have also been.
The call is coming now to us in pleasant cities and
nice little villages all over the United States, and the
time is here when we too are summoned from the
even tenor of our ways because the high white flashing
moment of service is come. Eleanor Warrender
was called quite suddenly from a stately career as an
English gentlewoman. She kept house for her
brother, Sir George Warrender, afterward in the war
Admiral Warrender. It was a lovely old country
house, High Grove, at Pinnar, in Middlesex County,
of which she was the chatelaine. There had been a
delightful week-end party there for which she was
the hostess. She stood on a porch embowered in
roses to bid her guests good-bye on an afternoon in
August. And she had no more idea than perhaps
you have who have touched lightly the hand of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
friends who have gone out from your dinner table
to-night, that the farewell was final. But two days
later in a Red Cross uniform she was on her way to
her place by the bedside of the war wounded.
There has been no more entertaining since, and one
cannot say when Eleanor Warrender shall ever again
see English roses in bloom.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE DEMAND DEVELOPS THE CAPACITY</p>

<p>The Viscountess Elizabeth D’Azy had been with
her young son passing a summer holiday at a watering-place
in France.</p>

<p>She had just sent the boy back to boarding-school
and herself had returned to her apartment in Paris
overlooking the Esplanade des Invalides. At the
moment she had no more intention of becoming a
war heroine than of becoming a haloed plaster saint
set in a niche in the Madeleine. Yet before she had
ordered her trunks to be unpacked, the nation’s call
for Red Cross women had reached her.</p>

<p>“It was so sudden,” she has told me, “and I was
so dazed, I couldn’t even remember where I had put
my Red Cross insignia. At last my maid found it
in my jewel case beneath my diamond necklace. I
hadn’t even seen it since I had received it at the end
of my Red Cross first-aid course of lectures.” The
maid packed a suitcase of most necessary clothing.
Carrying this suitcase, the Viscountess Elizabeth
Benoit D’Azy, daughter of the Marquis de Vogue of
the old French aristocracy, in August, 1914, walked
with high head and firm tread out of a life of luxury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and ease into the place of toil and privation and self-sacrifice
at the Vosges front where her country had
need of her.</p>

<p>That was, I think, the last time a maid has done
anything for her for whom up to that day in August
there had been servants to answer her least request.
Ever since then the Viscountess D’Azy has been doing
things with her own hands for the soldiers of France.
It was in the second year of the war that a gentleman
of France, General Joffre, bent to kiss her small
hand, now toil-hardened and not so white as it used
to be. There is a military group in front of a hospital
that she commands and they stand directly before
a great jagged hole in the wall torn there by a
German bomb, which, as it fell, missed her by a few
metres. The General is giving her the “accolade,”
and on the front of her white uniform he has pinned
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i> of France for distinguished service.
Last year, on behalf of her grateful country,
the Minister of War conferred on her another decoration,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médaille de Vermeil des Epidémies</i>. I
do not know what others may have been added since
to these with which the front of her white blouse
sagged last spring in Paris.</p>

<p>But the woman thus cited for military honours
had before this Armageddon as little expectation of
playing any such rôle as have you to-day who are,
say, the social leader of the four hundred in Los
Angeles or the president of a foreign missionary
society in Bangor, Maine. Her one preparation was
that two months’ course of Red Cross lectures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Many women of the leisure class were taking it in
1910.</p>

<p>“I think I will, too,” she had said to her husband.
“Some elemental knowledge of the scientific facts of
nursing I really ought to have when the children are
ill.” There were five children, four little daughters
and a son. And the Viscount thought of them and
reluctantly gave his consent.</p>

<p>“Very well, Elizabeth,” he had said. “I think I
am willing that you should hear the lectures. But
on this I shall insist, my dear: I cannot permit
you to take the practical bedside demonstration work.
I don’t wish to think of my wife doing that kind of
menial service even for instruction purposes, and I
simply could not have you so exposed to all sorts
of infection.”</p>

<p>Like that it happened when Elizabeth, the Viscountess
D’Azy, arrived at the battle front to which
she was first called at Gérardmer; she had had no
practical nursing experience. Oh, she got it right
away. She had quite some within twenty-four
hours. But up to now, this flashing white moment
of life which she faced so suddenly, she had not so
much as filled a hot-water bag for any one. And she
had never seen a man die.</p>

<p>At this military barracks where she took off her
hat to don the flowing white headdress with the red
cross in the centre of the forehead, one hundred
and fifty men, some of them delirious with agony,
some of them just moaning with pain, all of them
wounded and waiting most necessary attention, lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
on the straw on the floor ranged against the wall.</p>

<p>There weren’t even cots. And there was only herself
with one other woman to assist her in doing all
that must be done for these one hundred and fifty
helpless men.</p>

<p>The first that she remembers, a surgeon was calling
out orders to her like a pistol exploding at her
head. She got him a basin of water and some absorbent
cotton and she managed to find the ether.
Oh, his shining instruments were flashing horribly in
the light from the window. He was going to cut
off a man’s leg. “But, Doctor,” she exclaimed, “I
never had that in my Red Cross training. I don’t
know how.” She went so white that he looked at
her and he hesitated. “Go out in the garden outside,”
he commanded, “and walk in the air.” He
looked at his watch. “I’ll give you just three minutes.
Come back then and we’ll do this job.”</p>

<p>They did this job, the Viscountess D’Azy holding
the patient’s leg while they did it. “After that,”
she has told me, “I was never nervous. I was never
afraid. There wasn’t anything I couldn’t do.”</p>

<p>And there wasn’t anything she didn’t do. There
were always the one hundred and fifty men to be
cared for: as fast as a cot was vacated for the
grave, it was filled again from the battle-line. For
six weeks the Viscountess was on her feet for seventeen
hours out of every twenty-four, carrying water,
preparing food, dressing wounds, closing the eyes of
dying men. It took from eight in the morning until
five in the afternoon just to do the dressings alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Twelve men on an average died every night and they
wrapped them in white sheets for the burial, the
Viscountess D’Azy did, daughter of one of the proudest
houses of France.</p>

<p>One day the message came that the Germans,
sweeping through the nearby village of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dié, had
denuded the hospital there of all supplies. Would
the Viscountess with her influence, the commandant
begged, carry a report of their need to Paris. She
went to Paris and brought back a truck-load of supplies.
She and the driver were three days on the
return journey. German shells were again falling
on the road to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dié as they approached. The
chauffeur stopped in terror. “Go on!” commanded
the Viscountess. “Go on!” As the car shot forward
by her order, a bomb dropped behind them,
tearing up in a cloud of dust the exact spot in the
road where the car had halted.</p>

<p>Word reached military headquarters of Elizabeth
D’Azy’s skill in nursing, of her unflinching coolness
in the face of all danger. It was decided that the
war department had need of her at Dunkirk. The
town was under heavy bombardment, receiving between
three hundred and four hundred bombs daily.
At the barracks hospital, arranged at the railway station,
there were cots for two hundred wounded.
Sometimes a thousand men were laid out on the
floors. One night there were three thousand. And
there was only the Viscountess, who was the commandant,
one trained nurse, and some voluntary untrained
assistants. For a protection against the Zeppelins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
it was necessary that there should be only the
dimmest candle light even for the performing of
operations. As rapidly as possible patients were
evacuated to base hospitals. The commandant one
night was tenderly supervising the lifting into an
American ambulance of an officer whose wounds she
had just bandaged. She leaned over the wheel to
admonish “Drive slowly or he cannot live.” And as
she touched the driver’s arm there was an exclamation
of mutual surprise. The driver was A. Piatt
Andrews, under secretary of the treasury in President
Taft’s administration. And the last time he
had seen the Viscountess D’Azy he had taken her in
to dinner at the White House in Washington when
her husband was an attaché there of the French Embassy.
How long ago was all the gaiety of diplomatic
social life at Washington! A siren sounded
shrilly now the cry of danger and death in an
approaching taube raid. And the greeting ended
hastily, the hospital commandant and the ambulance
driver hurrying in the darkness to their respective
posts of duty.</p>

<p>The Viscountess has been in charge of a number
of hospitals, having been transferred from place to
place at the front. When I saw her, she was temporarily
in command for a few weeks at the hospital
which had been opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Les
Champs Elysées in Paris. She didn’t care about
her medals or her own magnificent record. It wasn’t
even the achievements of her husband, the Viscount
D’Azy, in command of the naval battleship <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jauré-guiberry</i> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>,
of which she spoke most often. The
Viscountess D’Azy’s one theme is her boy. Before
the war he was her little son. Now he is a tall and
handsome officer in uniform, at the age of nineteen,
Sub-lieutenant Charles Benoit D’Azy.</p>

<p>He wanted to enlist when she did. But she insisted
that he remain at school until he had finished
his examinations in the spring of 1915. He got into
action in time for the great push on the Somme.
Here at the hospital in Les Champs Elysées the
Viscountess shows me his photograph, snapshots that
she has taken with her kodak. Last night she walked
unattended and alone three miles through the streets
of Paris at midnight after seeing him off at the Gare
de l’Est. He had started again for the front after
his furlough at home. Her one request to the war
department is to be detailed to hospital duty where
she may be near her boy’s regiment. Her pride in
the boy is beautiful. When she speaks his name
that look of experience is gone for the moment, and
in the eyes of Elizabeth D’Azy there is only the soft
luminous mother-love, even as it may be reflected
in your eyes that have never yet seen bloodshed.</p>

<p class="caption center">LADY RALPH PAGET OF ENGLAND<br />
Descendant of American forefathers. She is a war heroine worshipped
by the entire Serbian nation for her consecrated devotion
to their people.</p>
</div>

<p>“Up to the time of the war,” the Viscountess said
in her pretty broken English as she looked reminiscently
out on the broad avenue of Paris, “I was doing
nothing but going to fêtes all day and dancing most
of the nights. But I think there is no reason why a
woman who has danced well should not be able to
do her duty as well as she did her pleasure. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N’est ce pas</i>?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
And from the records of the European
war offices, I think so, too.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE WOMAN WHOM A NATION ADORES</p>

<p>Among the English war heroines is Lady Ralph
Paget, whose name has gone round the world for
her splendid service in Serbia. In that defenceless
little land, exposed so cruelly to the ravages of this
terrible war, she commanded with as efficient executive
skill as any of the generals who have been leading
armies, one of the best-managed hospitals that
have faced the enemy’s fire.</p>

<p>Leila Paget had lived all her life in the environment
where ladies have their breakfast in bed and
some one does their hair and hands them even so
much as a pocket handkerchief. “Leila going to
command a hospital?” questioned some of her
friends, “Leila who has always been so dependent
on her mother?”</p>

<p>She is the daughter, you see, of the Lady Arthur
Paget, the beautiful Mary Paran Stevens of New
York, who, ever since her marriage into the British
aristocracy, has been one of the leaders in the Buckingham
Palace set. Leila Paget was, of course,
brought up as is the most carefully shielded and protected
English girl in high life. She grew up in a
stately mansion in Belgrave Square. She was introduced
to society in the crowded drawing-room there
which has been the scene of her brilliant mother’s
so many social triumphs. But she had no ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to be a social butterfly. She was a débutante who
did not care for a cotillion. You see, it was not yet
her hour. She was a tall, rather delicate girl who
continued to be known as the beautiful Lady Paget’s
“quiet” daughter. A few seasons passed and she
married her cousin, the British diplomat, Sir Ralph
Paget, many years her senior.</p>

<p>She had never known responsibility at all when
one day she sat down in the great red drawing-room
in Belgrave Square to make out a list of the staff
personnel and the supplies that would be required
for running a war hospital in Serbia. Her heart at
once turned to this land in its time of trouble because
she had for three years lived in Serbia when Sir
Ralph was the British Minister there. They had
but recently returned to England on his appointment
as under secretary of foreign affairs. And now she
had determined to go to the relief of Serbia with a
hospital unit. I suppose British society has never
been more surprised and excited about any of the
women who have done things in this war than they
were about Leila Paget. This day in the great red
drawing-room Leila Paget found her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">metier</i>. She is
the daughter of a soldier, General Sir Arthur Paget,
and what has developed as her amazing organising
and administrative ability is an inheritance from a
line of American ancestors through her beautiful
mother. But from her reserved, retiring manner
none of her friends had suspected that she was of
the stuff of which heroines are made. Now, as she
laid her plans for war relief, she did it with an expeditious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
directness and a mastery of detail with which
some Yankee forefather in Boston might have managed
his business affairs. With a comprehensive
glance she seemed to see the equipment that would
be needed. Here in the red drawing-room she sat,
with long foolscap sheets before her on the antique
carved writing desk. She listed the requirements,
item by item, a staff of so many surgeons, so many
physicians, so many nurses. Then she estimated the
supplies, so many surgeon’s knives, so many bottles
of quinine, everything from bandages and sheets
down to the last box of pins. And she planned to
a pound the quantity of rice and tapioca. Her hospital
ultimately did have jam and tea when all the
others were scouring Serbia in a frantic search to
supplement diminishing supplies. Without any
excitement, with an utter absence of hysteria as a
woman ordering gowns for a gay season in Mayfair,
Leila Paget gave her instructions and assembled her
equipment. It was, you see, her hour.</p>

<p>She arrived at Uskub in October, 1914, with the
first English hospital on the scene to stem the tide
of the frightful conditions that prevailed toward the
end of 1914. After the retreat of the Austrians,
Serbia had been left a charnel house of the dead and
dying. Every large building of any kind—schools,
inns, stables—was filled with the wounded, among
whom now raged also typhus, typhoid, and smallpox.
There were few doctors and no nurses, only
orderlies who were Austrian prisoners. At one huge
barracks fifteen hundred cases lay on the cots and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
under them; at another three thousand fever patients
overflowed the building and lay on the ground
outside in their uniforms, absolutely unattended.
Facing conditions like these, Lady Paget opened her
hospital in a former school building. And here in
the war zone she instituted for herself such a régime
as probably was never before arranged for an Englishwoman
of title.</p>

<p>She arose at four o’clock in the morning, and when
she slipped from her cot, no one handed her a silk
kimono. The regulation “germ proof” uniform
worn by women relief workers in Serbia consisted of
a white cotton combination affair, the legs of which
tucked tight into high Serbian boots. Over this
went an overall tunic with a collar tight about the
neck and bands tight about the wrists. There was
a tight-fitting cap to go over the hair. And beneath
this uniform, about neck and arms, you wore bandages
soaked in vaseline and petroleum. It was the
protection against the attacking vermin that swarmed
everywhere as thick as common flies. Wounded
men from the trenches arrived infested with lice, and
typhus is spread by lice. Lady Paget stood heroically
at her post by their bedsides, with her own
hands attending to their needs. What there was to
be done in the way of every personal service, she did
not shrink from. And she unpacked bales of goods.
And she scrubbed floors. And she assisted with the
rites for the dying. There had to be a lighted candle
in a dying Serbian soldier’s hand, and often her
own hand closed firmly about the hand too weak to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
hold the candle alone. Her wonderful nerve never
failed, but there came a time when her frail physical
strength gave out. She still held on, working for
two days with a high fever temperature before she
finally succumbed, herself the victim of typhus.
Her husband was telegraphed for. She was unconscious
when he arrived and it was three or four days
before he could be permitted to see her. Her life
hung in the balance for weeks. But finally recovery
began and it was planned for her to return to
England for convalescence. She and Sir Ralph
were attended to the railroad station by the military
governor of Macedonia, the archbishop of the Serbian
Church, and a guard of honour of Serbian officers.
The Serbian people in their devotion lined the street
and threw flowers beneath her feet and kissed the
hem of her dress. At the station the Crown Prince
presented her with the highest decoration within his
gift and the Order No. 1 of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sava, a cross of diamonds.
Never before had it been bestowed on any
other woman save royalty. Seldom has any woman
in history been so conspicuously the object of an entire
country’s gratitude. The street on which the
hospital stood was renamed with her name. On the
Plain of Kossova there stands a very old and historic
church, on the walls of which from time to time
through the centuries, have been inscribed the names
of queens and saints. Leila Paget’s name also has
been written there. A nation feels even as does that
common Serbian soldier whom she had nursed back
from death, who afterwards wrote her: “For me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
only two people exist, you on earth and God in
Heaven.”</p>

<p>Well, Leila Paget stayed with Serbia to the end.
After two months’ rest in England, she was back in
July at her hospital in Uskub. Sir Ralph had returned
with her, having been made general director
of the British medical and relief work in Serbia, with
his headquarters at Nish. In October the Bulgarians
took Uskub. When the city was under bombardment
during the battle that preceded its fall, Sir
Ralph arrived in a motor car to rescue his wife. But
four hours later he had to leave without her on his
way in his official capacity to warn the other hospitals
which were in his charge. “Leila, Leila,” he
expostulated in vain. She only shook her head.
“My place is here,” she said, glancing backward
where 600 wounded soldiers lay. Lady Paget and
her hospital were of course detained by the enemy
when they occupied the town. She remained to
nurse Bulgarians, Austrians and Serbians alike.
And she organised relief work for the refugees,
of whom she fed sometimes as many as 4,000 a
day. For weeks and months, it was only by dint
of the utmost exertion that it was possible to extract
from the exhausted town sufficient wood and
petrol just to keep fires going in the hospital kitchen
and sterilisers in the operating rooms. “These,”
says Lady Paget, “were strange times and in the
common struggle for mere existence it did not
occur very much to any one to consider who were
friends and who were enemies.” In the spring of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
1916, in March, arrangements were made by the
German Government permitting the return to England
of Lady Paget and her unit. Her war record
reaching America, the New York City Federation of
Women’s Clubs selected her as the recipient of their
jewelled medal. It is awarded each year to the
woman of all the world who has performed the most
courageous act beyond the call of duty.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">HEROIC SERVICE OF SCOTTISH WOMEN</p>

<p>Woman’s war record in Europe is now starred
with courageous acts. That day in Serbia Sir
Ralph, riding on while the people sprinkled their
mountain roads with white powder in token of surrender,
came to the Scottish Women’s Hospitals.
These had not even men doctors, as at Uskub. They
were “manned” wholly by women sent out by the
National Union of Women Suffragists in Great Britain.
And there was not a man about the place except
the wounded men in the beds. But Dr. Alice
Hutchinson, at Valjevo, and Dr. Elsie Inglis, at
Krushevats, with their staffs, also refused to leave
their patients. All three of these women made the
decision to face the enemy rather than desert their
posts of duty. They were all three taken prisoners
and required to nurse the German wounded along
with their own. Months afterward they were released
to be returned to England. Dr. Hutchinson,
who has been decorated by the Serbian Government
with the order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sava, when she evacuated her
hospital at the order of the Austrians, wrapped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
British flag about her waist beneath her uniform that
it might not be insulted by the invaders. Dr. Inglis
had all her hospital equipment confiscated by the
Germans. When she protested that this was in violation
of Red Cross rules, the German commander
only smiled: “You have made your hospital so
perfect,” he said, “we must have it.” Dr. Inglis
has been decorated with the Serbian order of the
White Eagle. Since then, at the Russian front with
another Scottish hospital, Dr. Inglis and her entire
staff have again been decorated by the Russian Government.</p>

<p>In London I heard the women of the Scottish hospitals
spoken of at historic <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s Chapel as
“that glorious regiment of Great Britain called the
Scottish Women’s Hospitals.” And the clergyman
who said it, spoke reverently in eulogy of one of the
most distinguished members of that regiment, “the
very gallant lady who in behalf of her country has
just laid down her life.” In the historic chapel, the
wall at the back of the altar behind the great gold
cross was hung with battle flags. Men in khaki and
women in khaki listened with bowed heads. It was
the memorial service for Katherine Mary Harley, of
whom the London papers of the day before had
announced in large headlines, “Killed at her post of
duty in Monastir.”</p>

<p class="caption center">MRS. KATHERINE M. HARLEY OF LONDON<br />
One of England’s famous suffragists, a number of whom have
died at the front in their country’s cause. Mrs. Harley was
buried like a soldier with her war decoration on the coat lapel
of her uniform.</p>
</div>

<p>In that other world we used to have before the
war, Mrs. Harley was known as one of England’s
most distinguished constitutional suffragists, not
quite so radical as Mrs. Despard, her sister, who is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>the leader of the Woman’s Freedom League. One
of her most notable pieces of work in behalf of votes
for women was the great demonstration she organised
a few years ago in that pilgrimage of women who
marched from all parts of England, addressing vast
concourses of people along the highways and arriving
by diverse routes for a great mass meeting in Hyde
Park. You see, Katherine Harley was an organiser
of tried capacity. And she, too, comes of a family
of soldiers. She was the daughter of Captain
French, of Kent. Her husband, who died from the
effects of the Boer War, was Colonel Harley, chief
of staff to General Sir Leslie Rindle in South Africa.
Her brother is Viscount Sir John French, former
field marshal of the English forces in France. And
her son is now fighting at the front. With all of
this brilliant array of military men belonging to her,
it is a curious fact, as her friends in London told me,
that Mrs. Harley did not believe in war. “Katherine
was a pacifist,” one of them said at the International
Franchise Club the night that the announcement
of her death was received there in a hushed and
sorrowful silence. But she believed if there must
be war, some one must bind up the wounds of war.
And it was with high patriotic zeal and with the
fearless spirit of youth, albeit she was 62 years of
age, that Mrs. Harley in 1914 enlisted with the Scottish
Women, taking her two daughters with her into
the service. She went out as administrator of the
hospital at Royaumont. And when that was in successful
operation, she was transferred to Troyes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
set up the tent hospital there. Then she was called
to Salonica. It was at Salonica that she commanded
the famous transport flying column of motor ambulances
that went over precipitous mountain roads
right up to the fighting line to get the wounded.
She was in charge of a motor ambulance unit with
the Serbian army at Monastir when in March, 1917,
at the time of the regular evening bombardment by
the enemy, she was struck by a shell. They buried
her like a soldier and she lies at rest with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix
de Guerre</i> for bravery on her breast out there at the
front of the conflict.</p>

<p>Violetta Thurston, you might think, if you met
her, a little English schoolgirl who has just seen London
for the first time. Then by her eyes you would
know that she is more, by the wide, almost startled
look in what were meant to be calm, peaceful, English
eyes. Violetta Thurston is the little English
nurse decorated by both Russia and Belgium who in
these last years has lived a life that thrills with the
adventures of war. She went out at the head of
twenty-six nurses from the National Union of
Trained Nurses who were at work in Brussels when
the Germans arrived. They improvised their hospital
in the fire-station. At last the English nurses
were all expelled by German order and sent to Dunkirk.
There Miss Thurston connected with the Russian
Red Cross.</p>

<p>She has written a book, “Field Hospital and Flying
Column,” on her experiences in Russia. There
were four days at Lodz that she neither washed nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
had her clothes off. And once she was wounded by
shrapnel and once nearly killed by a German bomb.
The last record I have of her she was matron in
charge of a hospital at La Panne in Belgium.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">HEROINES OF FRANCE</p>

<p>No girl has, I suppose, lived a more uneventful
life than did Emilienne Moreau up to the time that
she became one of the most celebrated heroines of
France. You haven’t if your home is, say, down in
some little mining village of West Virginia or in the
coal-fields of Pennsylvania, where you are going back
and forth to school on week days and to Sunday
school every Sunday. Emilienne was like that in
Loos. She was sixteen and so near the end of school
that she was about to get out the necessary papers
for taking the examination for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">institutrice</i>, which is
a school teacher in France. Loos was a mining village.
The inhabitants lived in houses painted in the
bright colours that you always used to see in this
gay and happy land. It was in one of the most pretentious
houses situated in the Place de la Republique,
and opposite the church, that the Moreau family
lived. The large front room of the house was
M. Moreau’s store. He had worked all his life in
the mines and now at middle age, only the past
summer, had removed here with his family from a
neighbouring village and he had purchased the general
store. It was with great pride that the family
looked forward to an easier life and a comfortable
career for the father as a “bonneted merchant.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Emilienne was his favourite child, his darling and
his pride, and she in turn adored her father. Often
they took long walks in the woods together. They
had just come back from one of these walks, Emilienne
with her arms filled with bluets and marguerites,
when on August 1 a long shriek of the siren at
the mines called the miners from the shafts and the
farmers round about from their fields. Assembling
at the Mairie for mobilisation all the men of military
age marched away from Loos.</p>

<p>That night the sun went down in a blood-red
glory. All the houses of Loos were bathed in blood-red.
“Bad sign,” muttered an old woman purchasing
chocolate at the store. And it was. Soon the
refugees from surrounding burning villages came
flocking by in streams, telling of the terrible Germans
from whom they had escaped. Most of the
inhabitants of Loos joined the fleeing throngs. Of
five thousand people, ultimately only two hundred
remained in the village. Among these were the
Moreau family, who, possessing in marked degree
that national trait of love for their home and their
belongings, refused to leave. “But,” said her father
to Emilienne, “little daughter, it will, I fear,
be a long time before you will gather flowers again.”</p>

<p>And it was. The Germans were in possession of
Loos by October. They poured petrol on the houses
and burned many of them. At the store in the Place
de la Republique, Emilienne, with quick wit, set a
bottle of wine out on the counter and they drank
and went away without burning, although they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
looted the store of everything of value. During the
year that followed, Loos remained in the hands of the
enemy. In the effort of the French to retake it, it
was often fired upon from the surrounding hills.
From the windows in the sloping garret roof, Emilienne
and her father watched many a battle until
the bombs began falling on the garret itself. They
were exposed to constant danger. They had to live
on the vegetables they could gather from the deserted
neighbouring gardens. By December her father was
ill from privation and hunger and anxiety, and one
night he died. Emilienne, girl as she was, seems to
have been the main reliance of the family, her
mother, her little sister Marguerite, and her little
brother Leonard, aged nine. The morning after her
father’s death, Emilienne went to the German commandant
to ask for assistance. How should she get
a coffin? How should it be possible to bury her
father? And the German laughed: “One can get
along very well without a coffin!” He finally permitted
her four French prisoners to dig the grave
and the curé of Loos, he said, could say a prayer.
But Emilienne was heart-broken at the thought of
putting her father into the ground without a coffin.
She and her little brother made one with their own
hands from boards she found at the deserted carpenter-shop
down the street.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1915 the bombardment of Loos
increased in violence. There were days at a time
when the whole family, with their black dog Sultan,
did not dare venture out of the cellar. In September,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Emilienne, ascending to the demolished garret,
where she lay flat on her stomach on the rafters,
watched a battle in which the strangest beings she
ever saw took part, fantastic creatures of a grey colour
who were throwing themselves on the German
trenches. As they advanced, she noticed that they
wore “little petticoats,” and she hurried to tell her
mother that these must be the English suffragettes of
whom she had heard, coming to the rescue of Loos.
What they actually were was the Scottish troops in
kilts, the famous “Black Watch,” who a few days
later had driven the Germans from Loos. As they
came into the village, Emilienne, braving a cyclone
of shells, and rallying her French neighbours, ran to
meet them, waving the French flag and singing the
“Marseillaise.” Thus, it is said, by her fearless
courage, was averted a retreat that might have meant
disaster along the whole front.</p>

<p>But the fighting was not yet over. During the
next few days, Emilienne, with the Red Cross doctor’s
assistance, turned her house into a first-aid station.
Some seven of the stalwart Scotsmen in the
“little petticoats,” she herself dragged in to safe
shelter when they had been wounded. Two Germans
taking aim at French soldiers she killed with
a revolver she had just snatched from the belt of a
dead man. When the enemy had been finally repulsed,
Emilienne Moreau was summoned by the
Government to be given the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i>.</p>

<p>A little later, her pictured face was placarded all
over Paris by the French newspapers. They wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
her to write her personal story. At first she shrank
from it: “It would be presumption on the part of a
girl. What would my commune think?” But
finally she was prevailed upon, and for two months
daily “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes Mémoires</i>” appeared on the front page
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Petit Parisien</i> with a double-column headline.
Even more honours have come to Emilienne. Great
Britain bestowed on her its order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of
Jerusalem and the King has sent her a personal invitation
to visit Buckingham Palace as soon as the
Channel crossing shall be safe.</p>

<p>With it all, you would think Emilienne, if you
met her, quite a normal girl. You see, she is young
enough to forget. And it is only occasionally that
in the clear blue eyes you catch a glimpse of tragedy.
Her smooth brown hair she is as interested in having
in the latest mode as are you who to-day consulted
the fashion-pages of a magazine for coiffures. I
have seen her on the sands at Trouville with a group
of girls at play at blind man’s buff in the moonlight.
And by her silvery laughter you would not know her
from the rest as a heroine. The next day, when they
were in bathing and the body of a drowned man was
washed ashore, one of the other girls fainted. Afterward
Emilienne said, and there was in her eyes a
far-away look of old horrors as she spoke, “Marie,
Marie, if your eyes had looked on what mine have,
you would not faint so easily.”</p>

<p>There is another French girl, the youngest war
heroine I know who has been decorated by any government.
And the case of Madeleine Danau is perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of special interest, because any girl in the
United States can even now begin to be a heroine
as she was. They say in France that “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la petite
Danau</i>” has served her country even though it was
not while exposed to shot and shell. She lives in
the village of Corbeil and she was only fourteen
years old at the time her father, the baker, was mobilised.
A baker in France, it must be remembered,
is a most necessary functionary in the community,
for as everybody has for years bought bread, nobody
even knows how to make it at home any more. The
whole neighbouring countryside, therefore, you see,
was most dependent on the baker, and the baker was
gone away to war. It was then that Madeleine
proved equal to doing the duty that was nearest to
her. She promptly stepped into her father’s place
before the bread-trough and the oven. She gets up
each morning at four o’clock and with the aid of her
little brother, a year younger than herself, she makes
each day eight hundred pounds of bread, which is
delivered in a cart by another brother and sister.
The radius of the district is some ten miles, and no
household since war began has missed its daily supply
of bread.</p>

<p>One day Madeleine was summoned to a public
meeting for which the citizens of Corbeil assembled
at the Mairie. She went in her champagne-coloured
dress of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toile de laine</i> and her Sunday hat of leghorn
trimmed with black velvet and white roses. And
there before this public assemblage the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Préfet des
Deux-Sèvres</i> pinned on Madeleine the Cross of Lorraine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and read a letter from President Poincaré of
France. In it the President presented to Madeleine
Danau his sincere compliments and begged her to
accept “this little jewel,” this Cross of Lorraine,
which shall proclaim that the valiant child of the
<span lang="fr">Deux-Sèvres</span> through her own labour assuring for the
inhabitants of the Commune of Exoudun their daily
bread, has performed as patriotic a service and is as
good a Frenchwoman as are any of her sisters of the
Meuse.</p>

<p>The ever-lengthening list of heroic women who
have distinguished themselves in this war in Europe
is now so many that it is quite impossible even to
mention any considerable number of them in less
than a very large book. You find their names now
in every country quite casually listed along with
those of soldiers in the Roll of Honour published in
the daily newspapers. And it is no surprise to come
on women’s names in any of the lists, “Dead,”
“Wounded,” or “Decorated.” The French Academy
out of seventy prizes in 1916 awarded no less
than forty-seven to women “as most distinguished
examples of military courage.” Among these the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i> has been given to Madame Macherez,
capable citizeness of Soissons, who has been
daily at the Mairie in an executive capacity, and to
<abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sellier who has been in charge of the Red
Cross hospital there during the long months of the
bombardment. The Cross of the Legion of Honor
along with the cross of Christ decorates the front of
the black habit of Sister Julie, the nun of Gerbéviller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
who held the invading Germans at bay while
she stood guard over the wounded French soldiers
at her improvised hospital.</p>

<p>It’s like this in all of the warring countries. And
all of these women with their war jewelery for splendid
service, are women like you and me. But yesterday,
and they might have been pleased with a
string of beads to wind about a white throat. Out
of every-day feminine stuff like this shall our war
heroines too be made.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The New Wage Envelope</span></p>


<p>The baby had been fretful all that hot summer
day. Every time he was passed over to the eldest
little girl, he cried. So Mrs. Lewis had to keep
him herself. All the twenty pounds of him rested
heavily on her slender left arm while she went about
the kitchen getting supper. With one hand she
managed now and then to stir the potatoes “warming
over” in the pan on the stove. She put the pinch
of tea in the pot and set it steeping. And she fried
the ham. She set on the table a loaf of bread, still
warm from the day’s baking and called to the eldest
little girl to bring the butter. “Aren’t we going to
have the apple sauce too?” the child asked. “Oh,
yes, bring it,” the mother had answered pettishly.
“I’m that tired I don’t care how quickly you eat
everything up.”</p>

<p>You see she had been going around like this with
the heavy baby all day while she baked, and there
were the three meals to cook. And she had done
some of the ironing and there was the kitchen floor
that had to be “washed down.” And the second
little girl’s dress had to be finished for Sunday. And
Jimmie, aged nine, whose food was always disagreeing
with him, was in bed with one of his sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
spells and called frequently for her to wait on him
in the bedroom at the head of the stairs. And she
had been up with the baby a good deal anyhow the
night before. So you see why Mrs. Lewis was what
is called “cross.”</p>

<p>Besides, she was just now facing a new anxiety.
When her husband came in from the shop and hung
up his hat and she had dished up the potatoes and
the family sat down to the evening meal, there was
just one subject of conversation. The State of New
York was making its preparedness preparation with
the military census that was to begin to-morrow, a
detailed inventory of man power and possessions.
Hitherto for America the war had been over in Europe.
Now for the first time it was here for the
Lewis family. And other similar supper tables all
over the United States were facing it too. “But you
couldn’t possibly go,” the tired woman said across
the table.</p>

<p>“I may have to,” the man answered.</p>

<p>“Then what’ll happen to me and the children?”
she returned desperately.</p>

<p>And he didn’t know. And she didn’t know.
Hardly anybody knew. We on this side of the
Atlantic are now beginning to find out.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis was drafted last week. The rent is
paid one month ahead. You can see the bottom of
the coal bin. There’s only half a barrel of flour.
And there are seven children to feed. No, there
are none of her family nor his that want to adopt
any of them as war work. Well, there you are.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
And there Mrs. Lewis is. In her nervous dread of
the charity that she sees coming, she slaps the children
twice as often as she used to and the baby cries
all day.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. Lewis, listen. Don’t even ask the Exemption
Board to release your husband. It’s your
chance to be a patriot and let him go. And this
war may not be as bad for you as you think. There
are women on the other side could tell you. Suppose,
suppose you never had to do another week’s
baking and you were rested enough to love the last
baby as you did the first, and all the children could
have shoes when they needed them, and there was
money enough beside for a new spring hat and the
right fixings to make you pretty once more. So
that your man coming back from the front when the
war is won, may fall in love with you all over again.
No, it’s not heaven I’m talking about. It’s here in
a war-ridden world. This is no fairy tale. It’s the
truth in Britain and France, as it’s going to be in the
United States.</p>

<p>“Somewhere in England” Mrs. Black, when her
country took up arms in 1914, was as anxious and
concerned as you are to-day. Her man was a car-cleaner
who earned 22 shillings a week on the Great
Western Railway. That seems appallingly little
from our point of view. But thousands of British
working class families were accustomed to living on
such a wage. The Blacks had to. It is true there
wasn’t much margin for joy in it. And when the call
to the colours came, it was to Mr. Black an invitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
to a Great Adventure. He enlisted. Well, the first
winter had not passed before it was demonstrated
that Mrs. Black and the children—there were five of
them—were not going to experience any new hardship
because of the absence of the head of the family
in Flanders. By January she was saying hopefully
one morning across the fence to her neighbour
in the next little smoke-coloured brick house in the
long dingy row: “If them that’s makin’ this war’ll
only keep it up long enough, I’ll be on my feet
again.”</p>

<p>To-day you may say that Mrs. Black is “on her
feet.” There are Nottingham lace curtains at her
front windows as good as any in the whole row of
Lamson’s Walk. The new chest of drawers she’s
needed ever since she was married is a place to put
the children’s clothes. And it’s such a help to keeping
the three rooms tidy. Santa Claus came at
Christmas with a graphophone. And you ought to
see Mrs. Black’s fur coat! Three other women who
haven’t got theirs yet were in the night she wore it
home “just to feel the softness of it.” Their hands,
do you know, hands that are hard and grimy with
England’s black town soot, had never so much as
touched fur before! And they’re going to wear it
soon, if this war keeps up. For they’re all of them
these new women in industry, like Mrs. Black.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black, to begin with, has her “separation
allowance” because her husband’s at the front.
That’s 12 shillings and sixpence per week for herself,
5 shillings for the first child, three shillings sixpence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
for the second and 2 shillings for each subsequent
child. Well, with the five children, that
makes 27 shillings a week coming in and there’s
none of it going to the Great Boar’s Head on the
corner, which always used to get a look-in on Mr.
Black’s weekly wage envelope before Mrs. Black
did. Now, in addition to this 27 shillings a week,
which in itself is 5 shillings more than the family
ever had before, Mrs. Black is at the factory where
she is making 30 shillings a week. That’s 57 shillings
a week, which is her household income more
than doubled. It’s why 60,000 fewer persons in
London were in receipt of poor relief in September,
1915, than in 1903, the previous most prosperous
year known to the Board of Trade. In the West
End of this town titled families are counting their
“meatless” days. In the East End, families are
celebrating meat days that were never known before
the war. The Care Committee used to have to provide
boots for over 300 school children in this district.
This year there was only one family, the
mother of which was ill, that needed boots!</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">RIGHT THIS WAY, LADIES, INTO INDUSTRY</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis, this is the answer to your anxious
inquiry: it’s prosperity that’s coming to you. In
every warring country there are women of the working
classes who have found it. You are going to be
mobilised for the army of industry as your husband
for the other army. Only there is no draft or conscription
necessary. The recruiting station is just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
down the street at the factory that recently hung
out that sign bright with new paint, “Women
Wanted.” See them arriving at the entrance gate.
Fall in line, Mrs. Lewis, and get measured for your
new uniform. Yes, you are to have one. It’s some
form of the things they call trousers. But I’m sure
you won’t mind that. Put it on. Put it on quickly.
In it you will find yourself the real new woman whose
coming has hitherto been only proclaimed or prophesied
on the waving banners of suffrage processions
you’ve watched parading on the avenues. You are
She for whom the ages have waited. This new
garment they are handing you has the pocket in it
for a pay envelope. You who have been toiling
for your board and the clothes you could get after
the rest of the family had theirs, are now a labourer
worthy of hire. Economic independence, the political
economists call it, as they take their pen in hand
to make note of the long lines of you going into industry,
later to write their deductions into scientific
treatises about you.</p>

<p>Now, it may not particularly interest you that you
are like this, a phenomenon of the 20th century,
but there are plainer terms that I am sure you will
understand. Listen, Mrs. Lewis: Every Saturday
night there is going to be money in your own pocket.
The convenience of this is that never again will you
under any circumstances have to go through any
one’s else pockets for it. Do you see? Right across
those portals there where they want you so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
that every obstacle that used to be piled in your
pathway has been so surreptitiously carted away
overnight, that you would hardly believe it ever
was there, lie all promised opportunities. Susan B.
Anthony pioneered for them. Mrs. Pankhurst
smashed windows for them. Mrs. Catt is even now
politically campaigning for them. And you, Mrs.
Lewis, are to enter in. What will happen to you
when you’ve joined up with the new woman movement?</p>

<p>Let us look at the advance columns over on the
other side. No one met them with: “Woman, back
to your kitchen!” Or, “This is unscriptural and
your habits of marriage and maternity will interfere
with shop routine.”</p>

<p>It was one of the most significant decisions of all
time since the day of the Cave Woman, that morning
when Mrs. Black got her aunt to come in to look
after the children and, hanging up her gingham
apron, walked out of the kitchen. Women were
doing it all over Europe. They are to be counted
now by the hundreds of thousands. Altogether we
know that they number in the millions although we
have not the exact returns from every country. By
1916 England had enrolled in industry 4,086,000
women and Germany 4,793,472 of whom 866,000
in England and 1,387,318 in Germany had never
before been gainfully employed outside their own
homes. France, Italy, Russia all have similar battalions.
And the important fact is that these new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
recruits are going into industry differently. Women
before had to push their way in. Women now are
invited in.</p>

<p>Heretofore there were all the reasons in the world
why a woman should not work outside her own home.
Three generations of employment had not yet sufficed
to efface the impression from the minds even of most
young girls themselves who went out to earn their
living that it was only a temporary expedient until
they could marry and be supported ever after.
Even when they discovered after marriage that they
were still earning their own living just as much in
their husband’s kitchen as anywhere they had been
before, public opinion and the neighbours disapproved
of their working for any one outside their
own family. Who, Madam, would sew on your
husband’s buttons? So strong was this sentiment
that it even threatened to crystallise on the statute
books. There were districts in Germany and in the
North of England where they talked about passing
a law against the employment of the married woman.
Then fortunately about this time the world came to
1914 and the revolution of all established thought.</p>

<p>Everybody sees now a reason why Mrs. Black
should work. Her country wants her to. And it
has swept aside to the scrap-heap of ancient prejudice
all the other reasons against the industrial employment
of women. Among the rest, the most material
reason, the most real reason of all, that woman’s
place was the home and every other place was man’s.
That was true. And it was one of the most incontrovertible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
facts that each woman who sought employment
came up against. Industry had never
been arranged for her needs or her convenience.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">MAKING INDUSTRY OVER FOR HER</p>

<p>Now it’s being made over, actually made over!
Already woman wins this victory in the Great War.
Don’t we all of us know industries where there
hasn’t been so much as a nail to hang a woman’s
hat on, where it wouldn’t be spoiled, let alone a room
in which she could wash her hands, or change her
working clothes? But go through Europe now and
you will scarcely find any place they haven’t tried
the best they could to fix up for woman’s occupancy.
She shall have the nicest hook that they can find to
hang her hat on. She shall have a whole cupboard,
a locker to keep it in, if she’ll only put it there to-day.
And oh, ladies, all of you listen, there’s even
a mirror to see if it’s on straight! Just a little while
ago I stood in a factory “somewhere in France,”
where they had built a beautiful retiring room with
lavatories and hot and cold water and a row of shining
white enamelled sinks. And one day of course
some thoughtful woman had brought in her handbag
a piece from her cracked looking-glass and fastened
it on the wall between two tacks, you know
the way you would? A little later, the superintendent
of the factory saw it there: “I sent right
out,” he told me himself with feeling, “and bought
this one.” And he showed me with pride the full
length plate-glass mirror that hung on the wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
where the little old cracked looking-glass used to be.
I think every government in Europe now has mirrors
listed among “necessary supplies.” I mention
it as significant of the anxious effort to please the
feminine fancy.</p>

<p>But the first most important thing that was done
in making over industry, was opening the door from
the inside for Mrs. Black’s arrival. Every door-keeper
to-day has his instructions from higher up
not to keep the lady knocking out in the cold. Her
coming was in the first instance heralded in England,
actually heralded with a flourish of trumpets. That
procession of 40,000 women that Mrs. Pankhurst
led down the Strand into industry, under the new
standard, “For Men Must Fight and Women Must
Work,” had flags flying and bands playing. And
the English Government paid for the bands. Parliament
records show that this Suffrage procession
was financed to the extent of 3,000 pounds, which
is $15,000. Has there ever been a more revolutionary
conversion than this to the Woman’s Cause?
For the first time in history, the woman movement
is underwritten by Government. It is with this support
that it’s going strong all over the world to-day.</p>

<p>The place that is being made for Mrs. Black and
her contemporaries is everywhere in the first instance
at least, being arranged through Government
intervention. With every new push on the front,
the soldiers that go down in the awful battalions of
death have to be replaced by others, which means
that more and more men must be “combed out” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
the shops back home. And to employers governments
have said: Hire women in their places.</p>

<p>To this employers answered as they have so many
times to us when we have asked to be hired: “But
women don’t know how.”</p>

<p>You see, it has always been so difficult for us to
learn. From the bricklayers and the printers up to
the medical men and the lawyers and the ministers,
there has always been that gentlemen’s agreement in
every trade: “Don’t let her in. And if she gets
in, don’t let her up, any higher up than you have to.”</p>

<p>But now over all the world, to every industry
that shows a slackening in production, there is issued
one common government General Order: “Teach
the Women.” And the employer looks questioningly
toward the work bench at the figure in the
leather apron there, who in some of the most highly
skilled trades, has always threatened to take off that
apron and walk out of the shop when a petticoat
crossed the threshold. There are shops in which
there has never been a woman apprentice, because he
wouldn’t teach her. Would he now?</p>

<p>The skilled workman was summoned in England
to the Home Office for a heart-to-heart talk with
the Government. He came from the cotton trade,
the woollen and the worsted trade, the bleachers and
dyers’ trade, the woodworkers and furnishers’ trade,
the biscuit trade, the boot and shoe trade, the engineering
trade and a great many others. The Government
spoke sternly of its power under martial
law. The skilled workman, shifting his cap from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
one hand to the other, began to understand. But
he still stubbornly protested: “Women haven’t the
mental capacity for my work.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” said Government.</p>

<p>“But it will take so long to learn my trade, five
years, six years, seven years.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so it will. Very well, then, teach the women
a part of your trade at a time, a process in which
instruction can be given in the shortest length of
time.”</p>

<p>“But the tools of my trade, they are heavy for a
woman’s hands.”</p>

<p>“There shall be special tools made.”</p>

<p>And there have been. So, the now famous “dilution”
of labour has been arranged. Mrs. Black is
“in munitions.” I saw her standing at a machine
that is called a capstan lathe, drilling the opening
in a circular piece of brass. There used to be employed
in this shop, 1,500 men and the man power
has been now so diluted, that there are 200 men
and 1,300 women. There are rows and rows of the
capstan lathes and down each alleyway, as the space
between them is called, there are lines of women
like Mrs. Black. They have to start the machine,
to feed it, and control it, and stop it. In three
weeks’ time most of them were able to learn these
repetitive operations. But they do not yet know
how to take the machine apart or to fix it if anything
breaks. So up and down each row there goes a
skilled man who is still retained for this, a “setter-up,”
he is called in the trade. And to supervise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
each section there is a foreman. It was the foreman
who called my attention to the machines.
“They are,” he said, “small lathes, specially adapted
to the women. We had them made in America since
the war.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">EASY ENOUGH TO ARRANGE</p>

<p>Like that you see, it is done. Sometimes to make
over the job for the woman, there was necessary
only the simplest expedient like adding the “flap”
seat in the Manchester tram-cars for the woman-conductor
to rest between rush hours. Even in
skilled trades it hasn’t always been necessary to
remodel an entire machine. Sometimes only a lever
has to be shortened. Sometimes it has been done by
the addition of “jigs and fixtures,” so that a process
formerly involving judgment and experience, is now
automatically performed at a touch from the operator.
Are there heavy weights to be lifted? The
paper factories met the situation by reducing the
size of the parcel. The leather, tanning and currying
trade put in special lifting tackle. The chemical
industries have trucks for transporting the
heavy carboys. The pottery and brick trades have
trolleys. And the engineering trade, for manipulating
the heavy shells, has put in electrical cranes
and carriages: they are operated by a woman who
sits in a sort of easy chair from which she only
lifts her hand to touch the right lever.</p>

<p>These and other innovations have been made in
accordance with a definite plan. You should hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
it just the way a government says it: “In considering
the physical capacity of a woman factory
worker,” the Home Office directs, “it should be remembered
that her body is physiologically different
from and less strongly built than that of a man.
It is desirable that the lifting and carrying of heavy
weights and all sudden violent or physically unsuitable
movements in the operation of machines
should so far as practicable be avoided. Often a
simple appliance or the alteration of a movement
modifies an objectionable feature when it does not
altogether remove it. When standing is absolutely
unavoidable, the hours and spells of employment
should be proportionately short, and seats should be
available for use during the brief pauses that occasionally
occur while waiting for material or the adjustment
of a tool.”</p>

<p>There is one further instruction: “The introduction
of women into factories where men only have
hitherto been employed will necessitate some rearrangement
in the way of special attention to the
fencing of belts, pulleys and machine tools.”</p>

<p>Well, there are now some ninety-six trades and
some 1,701 processes in which the workshop has
been gotten ready like this, and woman labour has
been introduced. You see how easily it has all
been brought about now, when every one, instead of
putting their heads together on How can we keep
the women out, is planning eagerly, How can we get
the women in.</p>

<p>And do you know that Mrs. Black cannot so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
as have a headache to-morrow morning, without the
English Government being sorry about it? Every
industry in the land has received its envelope, black-lettered,
“On His Majesty’s Business” and inside
this note: “Care on the part of employers to secure
the welfare of women brought in to take the place
of men in the present emergency will greatly increase
the probability of their employment proving
successful.” A nation, you see, is interested in
Mrs. Black’s success. “Who works fights,” announced
the Government when it invited Mrs. Black
into industry. The badge, a triangle of brass, that
she wears on the front of her khaki tunic, is inscribed
“On War Service.” The French women in
the munitions factories wear on their left sleeve an
armlet with an embroidered insignia, a bursting
bomb, which says the same thing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black, I believe as a matter of fact, did have
a headache one morning. And her output of munitions
fell off. Now that must not happen. For the
lack of the shells, you know, a battle might be lost.
The headache was investigated by the Factory Inspector.
And the Government made a great discovery,
I think we may say as important to us, to
every woman who works, as was Watt’s discovery
of the principle of the steam-engine that day he
watched the tea kettle. This was what the factory inspector
found out: Last night after Mrs. Black
left the shop, there was the dinner to cook, and it
was eight o’clock before she could get it ready.
Then, of course, there were the dishes to wash.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Then she swept all her house through. Then she
put the clothes to soak in the tub over night. Then
she worked on the stockings in the piled-up mending
basket until midnight. Then she went to bed, so
that she could be awake next morning at four o’clock.
And in the morning she built a fire under the “copper”
and heated the water and washed the clothes
and boiled them and hung them out on the line.
And Mrs. Black, having already done a woman’s
work before dawn, went out to fill in the rest of
the day at a man’s work!</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">BEYOND THE PHYSICAL ENDURANCE OF MEN</p>

<p>This, you should remember, was the woman whom
the government had hesitated about asking to work
“overtime” on war orders. Would it be possible to
extend labour’s eight-hour day, they had asked. The
Trade Unions, when asked, had said it would be a
great tax on the physique of men. It was more
than they were equal to under ordinary circumstances.
But, well, as an emergency measure, and
for the duration of the war only, Union rules would
be suspended to permit of overtime. But even then
the Government decided on the eight-hour limit for
women, in exceptional circumstances permitting
twelve hours. But an employer working women
longer should be liable to arrest!</p>

<p>Then came the Factory Inspector’s report laid
before the Home Office: Mrs. Black was working
a 20-hour day! Her case was not at all unique.
“Overtime” on home work is, of course, what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
great majority of women who have gotten into industry
in the past or into a profession or a career;
have been accustomed to. <em>Only nobody ever noticed
it before!</em></p>

<p>Now every War Office saw it as early as the first
year of the war: No woman could do a woman’s
work in the home and a man’s work in the shop and
maintain the maximum output. The efficiency experts
were summoned all over Europe. They were
shocked at such uneconomic management. Could
you expect any competent workingman to cook his
own dinner? There’d be a strike if you did. Why
in thunder, then, should Mrs. Black be expected to
cook hers? And every nation hurried to set up in
its factories the industrial canteen, where meals are
prepared and served to employés at cost price.</p>

<p>At one of these industrial canteens at a factory
in the suburbs of Paris, I sat down to dinner with
600 working people. The chef, who had shown me
with pride through his great store-rooms of supplies,
apologised for the day’s menu: He was humiliated
that there would be neither rabbits nor chicken, but
with a war-market one did the best they could. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a la carte</i> bill of fare proceeded from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors-d’œuvres</i>
through <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrées</i> and roasts to salads and to dessert
and cheese, and there was wine on every table. You
selected, of course, what you wished to pay for.
Marie, on my right, I noticed, paid for her dinner,
1 franc fifty. Jacques, on my left, I saw hand the
waiter 1 franc seventy-five. My check came to two
francs. It was a better dinner than I was accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
to for three times the money at the Hotel
Regina in the Rue de Rivoli. In England at the
great Woolwich Arsenal, Mrs. Black gets meat and
two vegetables for eightpence, which is 16 cents,
and dessert for 2½ pence which is 5 cents. For an
expenditure not to exceed 25 pence which is 50
cents, you can get at any of the industrial canteens
in England, the four meals for the day for which
the following is a sample menu:</p>

<p>What’s happened from Mrs. Black’s headache is
like a tale from the “Arabian Nights.” A magic
wand has been waved over the factory. “It should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
be made,” a Frenchman told me in his enthusiasm,
“a little Paradise for woman.” And that seems to
be the way they’re feeling everywhere. Government
solicitude in England for the new woman in industry
resulted in 1916 in a new act for the statute
books under which the Home Office is given wide
powers to arrange for her comfort. The scientists
of a kingdom have been engaged to study “Woman.”
Their observations and deductions are every little
while embodied in a “white paper.” There have
been some fourteen of these “white papers” through
which the discoveries are disseminated to the factories.</p>

<p>There is a staff of great chemists in government
laboratories who arrange the menus just mentioned,
which are really formulas for efficiency. Fat, protein
and carbohydrates have been carefully proportioned
to produce the requisite calories of energy
for a maximum output. They emphasise the importance
of the canteen with this announcement: “For
a large class of workers, home meals are hurried and,
especially for women, too often consist of white
bread and boiled tea. Probably much broken time
and illness result from this cause.”</p>

<p>There is a staff of competent architects who were
first called in that there might be provided a place
in which to eat the carefully prepared meals. “Environment,”
it is announced, “has a distinct effect
on digestion.” So a White Paper submitted diagrams
for the canteen building. “The site,” it said,
“should have a pleasant, open outlook and a southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
aspect. The interior should present a clean and
cheerful appearance. The colour scheme may be in
pink, duck’s-egg green or primrose grey.” Estimates
are furnished. A dining-room to be built on
the basis of 8.5 square feet of space per person may
be erected at a cost not to exceed 7 pounds per place.
Table and cookery equipment can be installed at a
rate for 1,000 employés of 30 shillings, 500 employés
32 shillings, and 100 employés 47 shillings
per head.</p>

<p>And well, you know how it is when you put so
much as a back porch on the house. You sometimes
get so interested in improving, that you can’t stop.
Often you remodel the whole house. Well, the factory
had to keep up with the new dining-room.
The White Papers began to say that the workroom
windows had better be washed, and the ceilings
whitewashed and for artificial lighting, shaded arc-lights
were recommended. “The question of lighting,”
the report reads, “is of special importance, now
that women are employed in large numbers. Bad
lighting affects the output unfavourably, not only
by making good and rapid work more difficult, but
by causing eye-strain.”</p>

<p>The doctors were now being assembled and soon
a White Paper admonished: “The effective maintenance
of ventilation is a matter of increasing importance,
because of the large number of women
employed, and women are especially susceptible to
the effects of defective ventilation.”</p>

<p>Plumbing came next with a White Paper that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
went exhaustively into the subject of lavatory equipment,
with illustrations showing the best fittings:
“Fundamental requirements are a plentiful supply
of hot and cold water, soap, nail brushes, and for
each worker an individual towel at least 2 feet
square, to be renewed daily. If shower-baths are
installed, it must be recognised that for women the
ordinary shower-bath is not applicable because of
the difficulty of keeping her long hair dry or of
drying it after bathing. A horizontal spray, fixed
at the level of the shoulders will overcome this objection.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">EVERY ATTENTION FOR THE WOMAN WHO WORKS</p>

<p>All of this reconstruction was rapidly going on
when one day it rained and Mrs. Black got her feet
wet going to work in the morning. And she was at
home in bed for two days away from the lathe.
Fortunately the carpenters were still around.
“There must be cloak-rooms,” came the hurried order
in a White Paper. “They should afford facilities
for changing clothing and boots and for drying
wet outdoor clothes in bad weather. Each peg or
locker should bear the worker’s name or work-number.
The cloak-rooms should be kept very clean.”</p>

<p>And really now, a woman’s health is a serious
matter! Every safeguard must be adopted for its
protection. If Mrs. Black is indisposed, it is too
bad for her to have to go all the way home to go to
bed. Immediate attention might prevent a serious
illness. Why was it never thought of before? Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
course, there should be a doctor always around at
the works. So the building plans were enlarged to
include a hospital. The largest building plans I
know of have been worked out by one English factory
that recently put up a whole village of wooden
houses for women employés, 700 of whom are provided
with board and lodging at 14 shillings a week.
There is a public hall, a club, a chapel, a restaurant
and a hospital. Many factories now have the
“hostel” for lodging women employés who come
from a distance. The hospital you will find now at
any factory of good economic standing, and the doctor
and the trained nurse and the “welfare supervisor.”
The Government directs: “At every workshop
where 2,000 persons are employed, there shall
be at least one whole-time medical officer and at
least one additional medical officer, if the number
exceeds 2,000. A woman welfare supervisor shall
be appointed at all factories and workshops where
women are employed.”</p>

<p>So now Mrs. Black is given a careful medical examination
when she first presents herself for employment.
After that, she is looked over at regular
intervals. At any time, if she so much as
appears pale, the doctor is right there to take her
pulse. Any little thing that may be the matter
with her is reported at once on the “sickness register.”
A Health of Munition Workers Committee,
appointed by Mr. Lloyd George with the concurrence
of the Home Office has directed, “Week by
week the management should scrutinise their chart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of sickness returns and study their rise and fall.”
Also any factory employing over 20 women is required
at regular intervals to fill out a questionnaire
concerning the environment and conditions of its
employés, and this record is kept on file at the Home
Office.</p>

<p>You see how scientifically the woman in industry
is handled? Why, if the munitions output fell off
this afternoon, the whole English Parliament might
rise to demand Mrs. Black’s health record to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black must not be allowed to be ill! She
ought not even to be permitted to get tired! Gentlemen,
pass her a cup of cocoa or hot milk in the
morning at half-past ten. It is a government order
which is obligatory for factories where she is employed
on specially fatiguing processes. At about
four in the afternoon, she should pause for rest and
a cup of tea. If she is engaged on a rush order, the
tea may be passed to her in the workroom. But it
is most advisable that she go to the canteen for it
and have a brief period of inactivity in an easy chair
in the adjoining rest room. This isn’t fiction. This
is industrial fact for women to-day. And there is
more. The Health of Munition Workers Committee
are now strongly of the opinion that for women
and girls a portion of Saturday and the whole of
Sunday should be available for rest. That Sabbath
day commandment, it is discovered, isn’t only written
in the Bible. It is indelibly recorded in the human
constitution. Even if you keep at toil for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
seven days, you are able to produce only a six-days’
output. Except for extraordinary, sudden emergencies,
“overtime” is a most wasteful expedient.
“The effect of all overtime should be carefully
watched and workers should be at once relieved from
it when fatigue becomes apparent.” Recently in a
“General Order” for the hosiery trade, a condition
is included “that every fourth week must be kept
entirely free from overtime.” A White Paper says:
“The result of fatigue which advances beyond physiological
limits (‘overstrain’) not only reduces capacity
at the moment, but does damage of a more
permanent kind which will affect capacity for periods
far beyond the next normal period of rest. It will
plainly be uneconomical to allow this damage to be
done.”</p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Lewis, you can see that something has
happened, that there’s an entirely new sort of place
in industry for woman on the other side, as there’s
going to be here. In France the gallant government
almost sees her home from work, at least they make
sure of her safety in getting there. When the employés
of a factory live at a distance involving a
journey to and from work by trolley or train, it is
permitted for the women to arrive fifteen minutes
later in the morning and to stop work at night fifteen
minutes earlier than the men. Thus they avoid
the rush hour and the congestion on the trains.</p>

<p>It was in a factory on the banks of the Seine that
I noticed another thoughtful attention. There were
hundreds of women engaged in making munitions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
and on the work bench before each operator in a
brass fuse filled with water to serve as a vase, was
a flower, fresh and fragrant! Great beautiful La
France roses, splendid roses <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de gloire</i>, bride roses and
spicy carnations made lanes of bloom up and down
the workroom. I turned to the foreman: “Is it
some fête day?” He shook his head: “The
flowers are renewed each morning. We do it every
day. Because the women like it.”</p>

<p>In England one of the important duties assigned
the Welfare Supervisor is to teach the employés to
play: “Familiarise the working woman with methods
of recreation hitherto unknown to her,” the instructions
read. So they have organised for her
dramatic entertainments and choral classes and they
are even teaching her to dance. One factory recently
announced: “We have decided to erect a
large theatre as a cinema and concert hall.” Really,
Alice in Wonderland met with no more amazing
surprises than has Mrs. Black.</p>

<p>And to make sure that she misses nothing that is
coming to her, the Home Office arranged its “follow-up”
system. A large staff of women inspectors are
travelling up and down England stopping at the
factories. In 1915 alone, they made 13,445 visits.
Is there anything more the working lady needs? the
Government always inquires when the woman factory
inspector returns from a trip. And it was the
woman factory inspector who brought word early in
the war, “Why, yes, the lady should have a new
dress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">EVEN THEY DESIGN HER CLOTHES</p>

<p>So the Ministry of Munitions took the matter up
and summoned the designers. As the result, the
most charming “creation” was adapted from the
vaudeville stage for industry. The girl “lift” conductors
at Selfridge’s Store in London are the prettiest
things you will find out of a chorus. Theirs
are called, I believe, “peg-top” breeches, and there
is a semi-fitted coat, the whole uniform in mauve
and beautifully tailored. Well, the Government has
issued a variety of patterns, some of course, for a
much less expensive outfit than this. There is one
uniform that costs not more than 4 shillings: sometimes
the firm even furnishes it and launders it.
The costume it is most desired to introduce is the
khaki trousers with the tunic and a round cap, because
it is really a protection for the workers against
the revolving machinery. Factories not yet quite
ready for the whole innovation, begin with the tunic
and a cap and a skirt. But when you have convinced
Mrs. Black how well she is going to look in
the other things, she’s ready to put them on.</p>

<p>The situation adjusts itself. This report has been
made on it to the Government. I quote verbatim
from the published Proceedings of Parliament and
a member’s speech: “The Ministry has spent a very
considerable amount of time in going into this matter.
It would seem to us as men a simple thing.
But at any rate now from all I have heard, they
appear to have solved the difficulties. The women’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
uniforms up and down the country vary, of course,
according to the duties they have to perform, but
they must strike all who have observed them not
only as useful and comely, but also as reflecting
credit on the fatherly care which the Parliamentary
Secretary for the Ministry of Munitions has exercised
over the many thousands of the daughters of
Eve who look to him as their protector.”</p>

<p>Daughters of Eve in your country’s service, is
there anything more that you require? Yes, one
thing more: Parliament, please hold the baby!
It was a response returned from Northumberland to
Wales. Every government summoning its women
in industry has sooner or later faced the request.
There were lines of women applying for Poor Relief.
But why not go to work, the authorities would
ask. And the child in her arms was the woman’s
answer. Not every woman like Mrs. Black had a
maiden aunt who could be hired to take care of the
children. So it happened that, figuratively speaking,
the baby was passed to Parliament. Those gentlemen,
exclaiming “Goodness gracious!” hastily
looked about for a place to lay it down.</p>

<p>And the public <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> has been promptly erected.
Sometimes it’s done by philanthropy, sometimes by
the factory, and sometimes at public expense.
“We’ll pay for it,” says perspiring Parliament, “only
hurry!” And they have hurried all over Europe.
The baby of a reigning monarch is scarcely more scientifically
cared for to-day than is the working woman’s
baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>Industry has been made over to adapt it to maternity!
A baby used to be the crowning reason of
all against woman’s industrial employment. Even
if you didn’t have one, you might have. And they
were very likely to tell you they couldn’t bother to
have you around. If you did succeed in getting
employment, some committee was sure to go “investigating”
while you were away from home, and
they’d report that your parlour was dusty and that
your children had a dirty face. You tried to tell
the sociologists, of course, that it wasn’t so bad for
children to have a dirty face as a hungry one, and
you’d wash them on Sunday. But no one would
understand and you never could adequately explain.
Now you don’t have to any more.</p>

<p>Every facility for first aid for the housekeeping
the woman in industry has left behind her, is being
arranged. They have bought a few more cups and
plates and it has been found that the meals at public
schools that used to be for poor children can just as
well be for everybody’s children. It’s a great help
to the maiden aunt. And if you haven’t one, and
you feel that you must go home to dust the parlour
or to see that little Mary puts her rubbers on when
she’s out to play, why that can be arranged. The
London Board of Trade, in a special pamphlet on
“The Substitution of Women in Industry,” pointed
the way to all nations with this paragraph: “The
supply of women can be frequently increased by
adaptation of the conditions of employment to local
circumstances. For example, one large mill in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
certain district where ordinary factory operatives
were scarce, obtained many married women by arranging
the hours of work to suit household exigencies.
In one department these hours were from 10
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> to 5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, while another branch was kept going
by two shifts of women, one set working from
7 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> to midday, and the other from 1 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> to
6 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>” Also a memorandum from the Health of
Munition Workers’ Committee says: “It is the experience
of managers that concessions to married
women such as half-an-hour’s grace on leaving and
arriving, or occasional ‘time off’ is not injurious to
output, as the lost time is made good by increased
activity.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">EXPERT AT HER JOB</p>

<p>You see now, there is practically no reason left
why a woman shouldn’t work outside her home if she
wants to. Such a nice place has been made for her
in industry, and she’s getting along so well. Let’s
take the British Government’s word for it. The
Adjutant General to the Forces in the report on
“Women’s War Work in Maintaining the Industries
and Export Trade of the United Kingdom” announces,
“Women have shown themselves capable of
successfully replacing the stronger sex in practically
every calling.”</p>

<p>It was before the war that the great feminist, Olive
Shreiner, wrote her book which has been called the
Bible of the woman movement. In it occurs a
memorable statement: “We claim all labour for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
our field.” Now it is our field. Women to-day are
working as longshoremen, as navvies barrowing coke,
as railway porters and conductors and ticket takers,
as postal employés and elevator operators, as brick-settlers’
labourers, attenders in roller mills, workers
in 78 processes of boot and shoe-making, in breweries
filling beer casks and digging and spreading barley,
in 19 processes in grain milling, in 53 processes in
paper making, in 24 processes in furniture making, in
boiler making, laboratory work, optical work, aeroplane
building, in dyeing, bleaching and printing
cotton, in woollen and velvet goods, in making brick,
glazed and unglazed wear, stoneware, tiles, glass,
leather goods and linoleum. In France a year before
the war, it happened in the baking trade that a committee
appointed to take under advisement the question
of admitting women reported adversely that
the trade was not “adapted” to women. To-day
there are 2000 women bakers in France. In all
countries the largest number of women are employed
in two occupations, in agriculture and in munitions.
England had last spring 150,000 women at work in
the fields and was in process of enrolling 100,000
more. In munitions the last returns show England
with 400,000, Germany with 500,000 and France
with 400,000 women.</p>

<p>In this the engineering trade, women have mastered
already 500 processes, three-fourths of which
had never known the touch of a woman’s hand before
the war. “I consider myself a first class workman at
my trade. It took me seven years to learn it,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
a foreman to me through the crashing noise of the
machines among which we stood, “but,” and he
waved his hand over his domain in which 1700
women were at work, “these women, at occupations
requiring speed and dexterity, already excel me.”</p>

<p>He led me to the side of a girl who was drilling
holes in brass. “See,” he said, “she does 1000 holes
at 50 centimes an hour. No man we were ever able
to employ, ever did more than 500 holes an hour,
and we had to pay him 75 centimes.”’</p>

<p>We came to the gauging department: “Here,”
he said, “women are more expert than men. See
how well adapted to the task are their slender, supple
fingers? And they work for 50 centimes an hour,
where we should have to pay men 80.”</p>

<p>Like this the evidence of woman’s efficiency at the
work they are doing, is everywhere in Europe. It
has now been written into the records that cannot
be gainsaid. That famous publication, <cite>Women’s
War Work</cite>, in announcing the 1701 jobs at which
a woman can be employed, asserts under the authority
of the British War Office that at all of these jobs
a woman is “just as good as a man, and for some
of them she is better.” Then they sent a special
commission over to see what women were accomplishing
in French factories. After a conference
with M. Albert Thomas, the French Minister of
Munitions, and a wide tour of inspection, the special
commission returned to England with this report:
“The opinion in the French factories is that the output
of females on small work equals and in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
cases excels that of men. And in the case of heavier
work, women are of practically the same value as
men, within certain limits (when machinery is introduced
to supplement their muscular limitations).”
Italy also presents its evidence. The <cite>Bolettino dell’
officio del Lavoro</cite>, Journal of the Italian Labour Department,
under date of October 16, 1916, had this
to say: “It is necessary to remove the obstacles to
the larger employment of women. As soon as manufacturers
show plenty of initiative and adaptiveness
for this new class of labour, and cease to cherish
preconceived opinions as to the inferiority of woman’s
work and as to the low wages it merits, the
labour of women will respond splendidly to the utmost
variety of demands.”</p>

<p>Apparently one controversy is now at rest: Woman
knows enough for all of these things that she
has been permitted to do. Thus far, it is true, it is
the unskilled and the semi-skilled processes at which
she is employed in the largest numbers. It was, one
might say, the basement of industry to which she
was first admitted. In every land that skilled workman
summoned to receive the government order,
“You must let the women in,” about to take his departure,
turned at the door with cap in hand to make
a stipulation. It was the last clause of the ancient
“gentleman’s agreement.”</p>

<p>“All right,” the Government replied, “not any
farther up than we have to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">ON THE WAY TO THE TOP</p>

<p>To-day at every convention or little district meeting
of any skilled trade, there is one question for
heated discussion, “How far are the women going?”
The only answer is the woman movement that keeps
on steadily moving. And it’s moving up. With
every year of the war there are more and more vacant
places. More and more of these are places high up
and higher up. And the women who are called, are
coming! There is Henrietta Boardman.</p>

<p>Henrietta Boardman, “somewhere in England”
has arrived at one of the highest skilled operations
in munitions, tool-tempering. She sits before a Bunsen
burner and holds the tool in the flame while it
turns all beautiful tints, straw colour, purple, blue or
red. She must be able to distinguish just the right
shade for its perfection. She does it so well that all
the tool-fitters in the shop now have the habit of
bringing to her, in preference to any other workman,
the tools they want tempered. Because hers last
longer! There sits next to her a skilled tool-temperer
who is a member of the Engineers’ Trade Union
and the tools that he tempers will last for three-quarters
of an hour: they are considered good by
the trade if they last three-quarters of an hour. But
the tools that Henrietta Boardman tempers are lasting
sometimes all night!</p>

<p>“It’s curious,” the foreman directing my attention
to Henrietta Boardman’s work commented. “Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
colour sense a woman seems to have. Nothing like
it in men. Lots of ’em are even colour blind.”</p>

<p>“So?” I replied. “Then you must be putting in
a great many women for tool-tempering.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” he answered, raising a warning finger.
And then he smiled. “She’s the first woman tool-temperer
in England. So far there’s only one other.
You see, it’s a highly technical operation,” he went
on to explain. “By the ‘diluting’ of labour scheme
we aim to keep women in unskilled processes. We
admit them to skilled processes only when it’s unavoidable.”</p>

<p>Now the workshop in which we stood, C-F-5, is
the tool-room, confined to highly skilled processes.
The employés, he told me, number 1000 and of these
about 34 are women.</p>

<p>There you have an excellent comparative view of
the outlook for women in the most desirable occupations.
The way, it is true, is still a little steep and
difficult. But with my eyes on Henrietta Boardman’s
bright flame, I saw that in making over industry
they at least have set the ladder up: it goes all
the way up! And they’ve made room at the top!
Every week of this ghastly war, there is more and
more room made at the top for women! It was in
November, 1916, that an English manufacturer
made the statement: “Given two more years of
war and we can build a battleship from keel to aërial
in all its complex detail and ready for trial, entirely
by woman labour.”</p>

<p><em>Then what will become of the labour of men?</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
That skilled workman, cap in hand, going down the
steps of the Government House, met Gabrielle
Duchene coming up. At least her message to the
Government has been carried right to the War Office
by the feminists in all lands. In England, after
Mrs. Pankhurst’s great triumphal procession, little
Sylvia Pankhurst, feminist, led another which served
as it were as a postscript to the first: it is in a postscript,
you know, that a woman always put the really
important thing she has to say. On the banner that
Sylvia carried in London’s East End was inscribed
the feminist message: “We are willing to work <em>for
a fair wage!</em>”</p>

<p>Gabrielle Duchene stopped the skilled workman
and showed him the message, which enunciates the
demand: For equal work, equal pay. “It’s your
only protection,” she urged. But he only grinned.
And he pulled from his pocket a scrap of paper:
“See,” he said, “my government agreement that woman’s
admission into industry is for the duration of
the war only.” And it is true, he has that agreement.
It is the basis on which all over the world
the bargain was made: “Teach the woman how.
It is a necessary but temporary expedient. When
you return from the front, you shall have the job
back. And the woman will go home again.” But
will she?</p>

<p>The message that went up to the Government
House asking equal pay for equal work is one of the
most significant measures in the new woman movement.
Ever since women began to be in industry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
at all, the wage envelope for them has been very
small, as lady-like an affair as an early Victorian
pocket handkerchief—and just about as
practical. Remarks of protest on the part of the
recipient were customarily met with irritation or derision:
Wages? Why, woman, what would you
want with more wages anyhow—to buy a new ribbon
to put on your hat? Now a man, of course, must
have all the wages that he can get: he has to have
them to buy the children’s shoes and to pay the grocery
bill and the coal bill and to support a wife who
keeps his house and darns his socks. And, even if
he has to have them to buy a cigar or a drink? Oh,
don’t ask foolish questions! A man has to have
wages to meet all of his expenses, a large part of
which is Woman. Now run along and be a good
little girl!</p>

<p>But the new woman in industry can’t be dismissed
so easily as that. Especially a feminist in khaki
can’t. And she was respectfully saluting Government
and begging to inquire if women were doing
men’s work so well as Government had said they
were, when would women be getting men’s pay?</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">EQUAL PAY IS COMING</p>

<p>And it was more than a “foolish question.” It
was a disturbing interrogation. Government looked
up surprised from its war orders and statistical investigations
to answer: “Why, really, don’t you
know, woman’s work isn’t the same as man’s. You
see, we have made over the machines for her. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
sometimes she stops for an hour and goes home to
wash the children’s faces.”</p>

<p>But the feminist said: “Isn’t it the output that
counts?” And she spoke of the better work and the
faster work than man that women were doing for
two-thirds men’s pay. See the girl drilling 1000
holes at 50 centimes an hour where a man once
drilled 500 holes for 75 centimes an hour!</p>

<p>And about this time the skilled workman, discovering
that the lady was getting a hearing, came
breathlessly running back to interpolate that men had
to be paid more because they knew more. Those
women, for instance, who were “gauging” with such
remarkable success knew only that one process, whereas
the men knew the whole trade.</p>

<p>But the lady had only a woman’s logic: “If I
wish to buy a dozen clothespins,” she insisted, “I
don’t care how much the person who makes the
clothespins knows, whether his knowledge reaches to
mathematics or Greek. A dozen clothespins just a
dozen clothespins are to me. What I am concerned
about is only the delivery of the dozen.”</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, Government everywhere said it
would think this matter over. Meanwhile the walls
of Paris began to flame out with a great red and
black poster that Gabrielle Duchene was putting up.
It is some four feet long by three feet wide and at
the top in large letters to be read a long way down
the street, it insists: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A travail egal, salaire egal.</i>”
And in every land the trained workman stopped to
stare up at a lady like this at work in front of a bill-board:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
“You fool,” she turned on him in scorn,
“can’t you see now that it’s equal pay for equal work
for men’s sakes?”</p>

<p>At last he began to. <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Duchene is the wife
of a celebrated architect in Paris. As the chairman
of the Labour section of the Conseil National des
Femmes, she had pled ineffectually for equal pay
for women’s sakes. When she cleverly changed the
phrase “<em>for men’s sakes</em>” it had a new punch in it.
The aroused Bourse de Travail formed the now
world-known <span lang="fr">Comité Intersyndical d’Action contre
l’Exploitation de la Femme</span> to back the feminist demand.
And organised labour in land after land has
begun to sign up its endorsement. For the flaming
poster points out in effect: <em>If a woman can be had
to drill 1000 holes at 50 centimes an hour, who will
hire a man to drill 500 holes at 75 centimes an hour?</em>
That was the little sum the feminist set labour to
work out the answer to.</p>

<p>And for the Government, there was Mrs. Black’s
breakfast. If it takes a breakfast that includes three
rashers of bacon to produce the maximum output of
munitions for a day, how many munitions will be
missing if you don’t get the bacon? Mrs. Black
wasn’t getting the bacon. Welfare supervisors reported
that while Mrs. Black ate her dinner with all
its formulated calories at the canteen, she didn’t eat
her breakfast there. In fact Mrs. Black didn’t seem
to eat much breakfast anywhere. It wasn’t the habit
of the British working class woman: She usually
started work for the day on merely a piece of bread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and a cup of tea. Mrs. Black couldn’t afford three
rashers of bacon for breakfast!</p>

<p>The matter was investigated. The average wage
for women in industry in England, it was found, had
been 11 shillings a week: in the textile trade, before
the war the best paid trade in the land, the weekly
wage was 15 shillings 15 pence a week. And women
wheeled shells in a munitions factory for 12 shillings
a week, for which a man was paid 25 shillings.</p>

<p>But it began to be arithmetically clear all around
that it wasn’t wise for a woman in England or France
or anywhere else to be working for too little pay to
buy a good breakfast! That reliable organ of public
opinion, <cite>The Times</cite>, announced September 25, 1916:
“Proper meals for the workers is, indeed, an indispensable
condition for the maintenance of output on
which our fighting forces depend, not only for victory,
but for their very lives.”</p>

<p>What should a woman do with wages to-day?
Why, she has to have them to buy not only a proper
breakfast, but to buy the children’s shoes and to pay
the grocery bill and the coal bill and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> or the
maiden aunt who keeps her house. Even if she has
to have them to buy a new ribbon for her hat—why,
she will go without her bacon to get it! What does
a woman have to have wages for to-day? Oh,
don’t ask foolish questions. At last she has those
mysterious expenses, even as a man!</p>

<p>I think that Lloyd George was the first man to see
it. Great Britain led the way with the now famous
Orders L-2, which has come to be known as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Munition Women’s Charter. There is assured to
women in the government factories and government
controlled factories equal pay on piece work, equal
pay on time work for one woman doing the work of
one fully skilled man, and a minimum of &#163;1 a week
for all women engaged on work that was formerly
customarily done by men. France followed with a
declaration for equal pay for piece work for women.
Governments have now enunciated the principle,
have adopted it in practice and have recommended
its justice to the private employer. Watch the
skilled workman himself do the rest! Among the
trade unions that have already stipulated equal pay
for equal work for women doing war work in their
craft are these: Engineering, cotton, woollen and
worsted, china and earthenware, bleaching and dyeing,
furniture and woodwork, hosiery manufacturing
and the National Union of Railwaymen.</p>

<p>There has begun, like this, the greatest making
over of all! Better than all the bouquets they’ve
handed us is the making over of our wage envelope
to man’s size! It isn’t finished yet. Girl lift operators
in London still get 18 shillings a week on the
same elevator for which men were paid 23 shillings.
On the tramways of Orleans, France, women conductors
get 2 francs and 2.50 a day for exactly the
same work for which men were paid 4 francs a day.
Nevertheless the new wage envelope is not so lady-like
as it used to be. It’s coming out in larger and
larger sizes. The London tailoring trade has increased
the women’s minimum wage from 3½d. to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
6d. an hour. In Paris the women conductors on the
suburban lines have been advanced from the former
4 francs a day to the men’s 5 francs. Glasgow has
1020 women conductors at men’s pay, 27 shillings a
week. London has 2000 women omnibus conductors
with the wage formerly paid to men, 38 shillings
a week. Even the German brewers have come to
equal pay for women. Thousands of women in munitions
in England are making 30 shillings a week.
Some at Woolwich are making &#163;2 to &#163;3 per week,
a few up to &#163;4 a week. Henrietta Boardman at a
skilled man’s job gets exactly a man’s pay, 1 shilling
1d. and 1 farthing an hour, amounting to about &#163;4
a week. At the sixteenth annual congress of the Labour
Party, held in Manchester, England, in January,
1917, the following resolution was introduced:
“That in view of the great national services rendered
by women, during this time of war and of the importance
of maintaining a high level of wages for
both men and women workers, the Conference urges,
That all women employed in trades formerly closed
to them should only continue to be so employed at
trade union rates (the wages paid to men).”</p>

<p>For the new woman in industry is too efficient to
be countenanced as a competitor in the labour market
to offer herself at a lower wage than men. Trade
unions may even admit her as a comrade, not yet but
soon. For she’s safer to them that way! In England
they are giving their cordial support to Mary
McArthur with her organisation, The National Federation
of Women Workers, in which there are already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
enrolled 350,000 women. In France they are
backing <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Duchene, who in many of the little
dim-lit cafés of Paris is holding meetings to organise
the women in industry into what the French call
“waiting unions.” Why waiting? Because the
men’s trades unions are ready even to make over
their constitutions to admit women to membership
if necessary, that is, <em>if women stay in industry</em>. But
they are waiting to see. And every little while they
pull out from their pocket a soiled scrap of paper to
look contemplatively at it. It is a government agreement.
The Government has said the women will
go home. <em>But will they?</em></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WOMEN WANTED AFTER THE WAR</p>

<p>Read the answer in the columns of “Casualties”
appearing in the daily papers from Petrograd to Berlin
and Paris and London and now New York.
How many millions of men have been drafted from
industry into the awful battalions of death, no government
says. But we at least know with too, too
terrible certainty, that the jobs to which no man will
ever return from the front, now number millions and
millions. And there is going to be a world to be
rebuilded! Every nation must enlist all of its resources
if it is to hold its own in the international
markets of the future. The new woman in industry,
her country is going to keep right on needing in
industry!</p>

<p>Her husband and her children may need her there!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
After the men that are dead, there are millions more,
the maimed, the halt and the blind, for whom women
must work for at least a generation after the fight is
finished.</p>

<p>And her employer is going to need her! See all
the rows and rows of little capstan lathes made
smaller for a woman’s hand? See the slender, supple
fingers so well adapted to, we will say, gauging.
See Henrietta Boardman with her finer colour sense
for tool tempering than any man in C-F-5. <em>See,
oh, see the girl who drills 1000 holes an hour, where
the man drilled 500!</em></p>

<p>Listen to Sir William Beardmore, owner of a projectile
factory at Glasgow, in an address before the
Iron and Steel Institute: “In the turning of the
shell body, the actual output by girls with the same
machines and working under exactly the same conditions,
and for an equal number of hours, is quite
double that of trained mechanics. In the boring of
shells the output is also quite double, and in the
curving, waving and finishing of shell bases, quite
120 per cent. more than that of experienced mechanics.”</p>

<p>Again, in the workshops of Europe, above the
rattle and the roar of crashing machinery in shop
after shop, I hear the echo of some foreman’s voice:
“Here and here and here we shall never again employ
men because we cannot afford to.” In one great
factory on the banks of the Seine where I inquired,
“Are you going to keep women after the war?” an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
American superintendent who had been brought over
from Bridgeport, Connecticut, answered promptly:
“Sure, 9000 of ’em. We’re going to convert this
into an automobile factory and we’re not going to
throw all this specially made-to-measure-to-woman-size
machinery on the scrap-heap, you know.”</p>

<p>And the British Association for the Advancement
of Science has investigated and decided and announced:
“Where female labour is either underpaid
or is obviously superior to male labour, a special inducement
offers itself to employers to retain the women.”</p>

<p>Can’t you see the efficiency expert at the elbow of
Government, writing “Void” across the face of that
scrap of paper? Industry cannot afford to let the
women go.</p>

<p>And there are all the cloak-rooms with the plate-glass
mirrors and the canteen dining-rooms done in
pink, and blue, and duck’s-egg green and the new
uniforms that Parliament made for the woman in industry!
Oh, gentlemen, after all, why should she go
home? For the new place in industry is the most
comfortable place in which she has ever been in the
world! Oh, I know the sociologists used to talk
about the factory as so unhealthful for a woman.
But you see, that was because no man knew how hard
was domestic labour: he had never done it. And it
was before the experts began to gather data on how
unhealthful is the home.</p>

<p class="center">FACTORY WORK EASY COMPARED WITH KITCHEN
WORK</p>

<p>There is now a most interesting investigation under
way in London. It is a scientific intensive study of
the housewife, who is at last to be tabulated and
indexed, just like any other labourer. The Women’s
Industrial Council, who have undertaken it with the
endorsement of the Government, announce: “It is
quite probable the results may prove that the stretching
motions involved in such domestic tasks as the
washing of heavy sheets and blankets are more harmful
than the stretching motions of the shop assistant
or the vibrations which certain engineering employés
meet in their work.” I went one day in London with
the sociological investigator who is trying to find this
out. She took me to Acton, which is the district
where the washing is done for the great city. There
are probably more laundries here than in any similar
area in the world. We stopped to look at one of
them. It is in a sanitary, new, up-to-date building
with plenty of light and air and every new labour-saving
device known to the trade. Then we called
at some of the little cottages where live the women
who work at this laundry. But to-day is Monday,
which is the “slack” day of the week in the laundry
business, and on Monday the employés remain at
home to do their own “wash,” with the same appliances
that have been used in home industry for
a hundred years! The woman who came to the
door when we knocked had just taken her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
out of the suds. She was still wiping them on
her gingham apron as she talked. Do you know
what she said? At house after house it was
this, that Monday at home was her hardest day
of the week. “O, yes, ma’am,” she said, “much
harder than any of the days that I am at the laundry.”
Why? Because at the laundry she has no
lifting of any kind to do and no backbreaking scrubbing
over a washboard. It is done by machinery,
or if there are heavy sheets that must be lifted by
hand, men are employed to do it. At home even
when she’s so fortunate as to have a faucet, all of
the water she must carry in pails from the sink to
the “copper” to be heated.</p>

<p>Do you know, each time as we turned from a cottage
door where the woman in the gingham apron
stood wiping her wet hands, I thought of that lady
in the engineering trade who operates an electrical
crane from her easy chair; and the women conductors
in Manchester sitting down between fares on the
“flap” seats put in for their comfort. I think I know
what the medical journal, <cite>The Lancet</cite>, means when
it announced in the February, 1917, number that
“Factory work, under fitting conditions may be so
beneficial to women that it may lead to permanent
benefit to the race.” And I am not surprised to
learn that the Insurance Department of the English
Government has recently discovered that the greatest
percentage of illness among women occurs among
domestic workers.</p>

<p>You see, these new tasks are not so much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
laborious than the old as the world feared. And
this war has somehow brought about the most undreamed
of readjustments. In a London tube station
I came upon one of them: my startled gaze encountered
a man on his knees scrubbing the floor and
a woman at the ticket window taking tickets!</p>

<p>Do you know, the more I see of the woman in
industry, the more it looks to me as if she could stand
it. Anyhow, she’s stronger than she used to be.
One insurance society at Manchester with 26,000
members found that it paid out for sickness benefits
in 1915, £300 less than in 1914. The insurance
actuary attributed the improved health to the better
food and better clothing the members were now able
to buy through the wages they were receiving in the
munitions factories. The annual report of Great
Britain’s chief inspector of factories and workshops
for 1916, commenting on the good health of the
women employés, observes: “There can be little
doubt that the high wages and the better food they
have been able to enjoy in consequence, have done
much to bring about this result.” And you don’t
find among employers any more the complaint that
women employés are less reliable than men because
of their more frequent absences on account of illness.
Very likely they may once have been so.
Only a very strong woman could have been equal to
the old overstrain of a man’s work in the shop plus
a woman’s work in the home. And there was often
a marked lowering of her vitality and efficiency.
But the new improved man’s size wage envelope is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_">[194]</span>
proving, you see, the effectual remedy. Wages
enough to buy good food and then to pay for some
one to cook it—that has made a new woman of this
woman in industry.</p>

<p>And she doesn’t want to go back to general housework
in her own home, and to the “home” meals of
white bread and boiled tea which the Home Office has
specifically pointed out are not good enough on which
to produce shells. She’s accustomed now to her
breakfast bacon! The workingman’s wife at household
labour had no Saturday half holidays in the
kitchen. She had something like a sixteen hour day
with no laws against overtime. Nobody bothered
about how many hours she worked. Nobody
counted her food calories. Nobody brought her
roses. Nobody taught her to dance. Nobody
noticed that she ought to be happy, without which
she couldn’t be efficient. Most of all, gentlemen,
there wasn’t any wage envelope there!</p>

<p>Do you know of any reason why she should wish
to go back? Some 3000 of her were asked about it
through a questionnaire recently sent out in England.
And of these 3000, 2500 answered: “I prefer
to remain in the work I am now doing.” I am
sure Mrs. Black would.</p>

<p>And I know the world is going to be very much
surprised about it. But I think that Mr. Black,
when he returns from the front, will prefer that she
should. For Mr. Black is going to get a better dinner
that way! The industrial canteen can cook better
and cheaper for him and Mrs. Black than she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
could at home. She can’t make plum pudding in
the home, as they can at the canteen for 2d. a portion.
The chef who is buying for 1500 people gets rates
that she never could for seven from the huckster and
the fish-monger and the rest. Besides, Mrs. Black
never had any special training for cooking, as she
now has for engineering. In the shop she has learned
to do one thing very well indeed. In her home
there wasn’t any one thing she ever had learned to
do very well. And she worked ineffectually and
inefficiently at several highly skilled occupations:
child rearing and sewing and cooking and baking
and laundry work and, occasionally, nursing. Isn’t
it remarkable at any stage of the world’s evolution,
that woman should have been expected to carry a
schedule like that? You never found Mr. Black
attempting to be a carpenter and a tailor and a
plumber and a gardener and a whole lot of other
useful trades all in one. No, Mr. Black’s rule always
was, stick to one trade. Jack-of-all-trades!
Why, everybody knows that he could have been master
of none!</p>

<p>And Mrs. Black wasn’t. Now, if after the war,
she prefers to stay in engineering or some other trade,
why should Mr. Black worry? The lady will pay
for her own dinner and other things besides. She
can send the wash to the laundry, and the baby will
be at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> for the day, and the children will
have dinner at school. And at night, the family will
have supper together, which Mr. and Mrs. Black
on their way home from the factory can bring from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the communal kitchen. Governments already have
started the fire in the new cookstove in the communal
kitchen which England has set up in London and
Germany in Berlin, because Ministries of Food have
decided food can be more scientifically and efficiently
cooked there than in the homes of the working people.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE NEW IMPROVED HOME</p>

<p>Oh, can there be any one who would still wish to
take away the new wage envelope? Think what
it’s already done for the working class home! Children
with shoes on their feet, you know. Women in
England are wearing fur coats. Women in France
who once wore sabots are now wearing shoes for
which they have paid 40 francs, which is $8 a pair.
In every warring country working women are shopping,
shopping, shopping, as they never shopped before.
O yes, it’s thrift and prudence and all that’s
proper, to put your earnings in war bonds instead.
The rainy day, you know, that’s ahead. And of
course one must, for patriotism’s sake, put some of it
in war bonds, but not quite all. You see, when
there have been almost all rainy days behind and
you’ve always wanted something you couldn’t have?
Well, Mrs. Black thinks you might as well live in
the sunshine and have it, now you can.</p>

<p>That’s the way affluence seems to have happened
to the working class home all over Europe. Prosperity
is fairly gilding over every district in which
a munitions plant has arisen. And, oh, well, what
if it is gilt? Gilt’s good for little cheerless dingy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
houses. Do you know that, next to the war trades,
the most flourishing trade in all Europe to-day is
the cheap jewelry trade? There are places in London’s
East End where every other shop or two has
come to be a jeweller’s shop, with the windows hung
splendidly with all the shining trinkets that bring a
shining light to women’s eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Black was home on leave a while ago. He
stopped the first thing at the jeweller’s round the
corner in Hardwick Row and bought the gold chain
and the locket Mrs. Black’s wearing now with his
picture in it. Do you know, it was so long since
he’d given his wife a present, not since their courting
days, that he’d forgotten how? He was a lot more
awkward about it than he is about facing a fusillade
of German gun-fire. The perspiration just stood out
on his forehead as he laid the little package on the
kitchen table and said, “Mary, here’s something I
thought you might like.”</p>

<p>There was a note in his voice by which she knew
it wasn’t bloaters from the fish-shop over the way.
But she no more expected what it really was than
she hoped for an angel to lean out of the windows
of the sky and say, “Mary Black, here’s a gold crown
for you.” The paper crackled in the silent room
while she untied the string. The chain just shimmered
once through her fingers. Her lips trembled.
With a little cry, “O Jim!” she turned to lay her
head in the old forgotten place on his shoulder.
And there she sobbed out all the bitterness of seven
years’ married hardship and privation with the bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
and rearing of five children in three rooms on 22
shillings a week.</p>

<p>Oh, there are things that gold chains are good for
more than show. The famous uses of adversity are
various. But they have been much oversung. And
after all, God in his heaven perhaps knows that even
a war may be worth while, if it’s the only way.
Two wage envelopes are better than one. The new
woman with the old love revived in her heart, I’m
sure, won’t be so often cross and she won’t have to
slap the children so much as she did. Just think of
the new home that the man at the front’s coming back
to! Mrs. Black’s saving now for a piano!</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis, are you ready? The work-whistle
calls you. My morning paper to-day advertises for
a New York department store: “To patriotic
women seeking practical means of expressing their
earnestness: During the coming season, women of
intelligence will have the greatest opportunity that
was ever offered them to become producing factors
on the nation’s industrial balance sheet. Whether
they need to work or not, they should work, because
it will make them happier and give them a sense of
satisfaction as nothing else in the world can under
present circumstances. We can give many women
work to do to occupy part of their time. This part-time
work affords a woman, if she has home duties,
plenty of leisure for her own housework—she need
not leave her home in the morning until after the
man of the house goes. She may return in the
evening before he does—she will have more money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
for her home or for herself and be an independent
producing factor in her community, helping herself,
her home, and in this way her country in a time
when this kind of help is most needed.”</p>

<p>An American woman to-day will find opportunities
for work on every hand. The Homestead Works
of the Carnegie Steel Company has 1000 women
on the pay roll. At McKee’s Rocks, Pa., the
Pressed Steel Car Company has 100 girls building
artillery cars for use on the French front. The
Farrell plant of the American Sheet &amp; Tin-plate
Company at Sharon, Pa., is employing women at
$4.50 a day. A munitions factory at Dayton, Ohio,
has 5000 women working at men’s pay. The Detroit
Taxicab and Transfer Company have women
operating their electric taxicabs at the wages formerly
paid to men. The United Cigar Stores Company
is offering women salesmen men’s wages. At
the July, 1917, Lumbermen’s Convention at Memphis,
Tenn., the Southern Pine Association by a
unanimous vote decided that women employed in
men’s places at the lumber camps should be paid
the same salaries formerly paid to men.</p>

<p>And Gabrielle Duchene’s flaming poster has sent
a light across the sea. The American Federation
of Labour has voted: “Resolved that we endorse
the movement to obtain from all governments at the
time of the signature of the Treaty of Peace, the
establishment of an international agreement embodying
the principle of equal pay for equal work regardless
of sex.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>

<p>So? Then no one really expects the new woman
in industry to go home after the war. There is a
great High Court of the Ages in which man may
propose the regulation of the Universe, but God
Himself disposes. And that soiled scrap of paper
will be, after all, only a scrap of paper in the great
whirlwind of economic law that bloweth where it
listeth.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Open Door in Commerce</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> has just happened. A hidden hand
has touched a secret spring. A closed door in a
blank wall has opened. And one in the long cloak of
authority seems to be standing at the threshold pleasantly
beckoning the Lady to cross formerly forbidden
portals.</p>

<p>For I feel like that, like a little girl living in a
fairy tale that is turning true right before my eyes.
This morning there has arrived in my mail a letter
personally addressed to me from the New York University
School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance.
It announces that the entrance of the United States
into the war has revolutionised American business.
That hundreds of thousands of men off for the front
are leaving behind them hundreds of thousands of
vacancies. That commercial houses are facing a
shortage of trained and capable assistants. That to
fill the positions which are daily presenting themselves,
women must enter business. That to give
them the necessary training, this school offers no less
than 142 courses from which they may make their
preparation for executive positions of responsibility.</p>

<p>It is the first time that I and the League for Business
Opportunities for Women to which I belong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
have ever thus received a personal invitation to the
wide open world of commerce. The League since
its inception some five years ago has been alertly engaged
in looking, as its name implies, for business
opportunities for women. We have always been
obliged to look pretty persistently for them. Never
before have they been presented to us. Now, see,
the way is clear, they tell us, right up the steeps of
high finance.</p>

<p>The bursting bombs of war have done it. A ghastly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place aux Dames</i>, it is in truth. But the stage
is set. The cue is given. There is not even time to
hesitate. Draughted, the long lines come on with
steady tread. Now our battalions fall in step with
the battalions of the Allies and the Central Powers.
For English or Hun or French or Magyar or Russian
or Serb or American, the woman movement is one
like that. Through the same doorway of opportunity
we all of us shall enter in. There are blood
stains on the lintel, I know. But this door, for the
first time set ajar, is the only way, it appears, between
the past and the future. With the invitation
from the New York School of Commerce on my desk
before me, I too am at the threshold where the centuries
meet. Down the vista that stretches before
me, I look with long, long thoughts.</p>

</div>

<p>And once more, Cecile Bornozi somewhere in Europe
is passing the sugar. In pursuit of food conservation,
hotel waiters have a way of removing the
sugar bowl to the dining-room sideboard and thoughtfully
forgetting to offer it a second time. And the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>pretty young woman in the chic hat, who sat opposite
me at breakfast that morning, was near enough to
reach it and daring enough to commandeer the sugar
bowl for our common use. There is nothing, I believe,
like a lump of sugar that so quickly makes war-time
travellers kin. That is the way I came to know
Cecile Bornozi, new woman in commerce.</p>

<p>She is a type distinct from her predecessors in that
old world of ours that is going up in battle smoke.
Her brown hair is done in as coquettish a curl on
her forehead, her eyes are as sparkling blue, her lips
are as curving red as any girl’s who used to have
nothing to do but to dance the tango and pour afternoon
tea. But her horizon has widened beyond the
drawing-room. Nor is she the business woman
whom we have had with us for a generation. Why,
the stenographer who takes my dictation is a business
woman. But from her hand bag as another
woman might produce a shopping list, Cecile Bornozi
has just drawn forth a $50,000 bill of sale to her
for a freight steamer.</p>

<p>She has just purchased it because of the increasing
scarcity of tonnage in which to transport the fire
brick that she is buying for the reconstruction of
factory furnaces in the devastated districts of France.
Yesterday she shipped 90 cwt. of oil boxes and bearings
and 6 railway coal wagons. In the past few
months she has sent over some 2000 railway wagons.
Like this, during the past year, she has expended a
million dollars for railway rolling stock that she
rents to the French Government. She is specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
commissioned by France for this undertaking, as her
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement</i> spread
in front of my breakfast roll shows to me and all of
the Allies. A shipper has to have a license like this
in these days. It is what secures for her her export
permit from the London Board of Trade. Now she
sets down her coffee cup and folds her newspaper
and is off for India House in Kingsway where fore-gather
other merchants who have confidential appointments
with the War Office and the English Government.
Upon her decisions to-day will depend
so much more than the selection of a ribbon to match
the blue of her eyes or the choice of the card to win at
an afternoon bridge whist party. Her care and her
forethought, her planning and her enterprise must
outwit even the German submarines and get the
goods across the English Channel to keep the transportation
lines of a nation open for communication
with the front. And there will be no superior at her
elbow to tell her how.</p>

<p>“I like big ventures. I like to do things myself.
I’d sell flowers on the curb before I’d consent to be
any one’s else employé,” the new woman in commerce
flashed back at me as she buttoned her coat
collar and started out in a ten o’clock morning fog.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">RISING TO THE NEW OCCASION</p>

<p>You see, it’s like that. The big venture is the
fascinating field that lies beyond humdrum directed
routine. We have by now forgotten the stir that
was created when perhaps thirty years ago the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
woman walked into a business house to take her
place at a typewriter desk. Let us not lose sight
of the innovation of our own day that is about to
command attention: the woman at the typewriter is
rising. I think we shall see her take the chair before
the mahogany desk in the president’s office.</p>

<p>The Woman’s Association of Commerce of America
was recently organised at Chicago in a convention
of business women gathered from cities from
New York to Chicago. For the first time adequate
training to fit a woman for real commercial responsibilities
is beginning to be as freely offered as to men.
Cecile Bornozi, widely known as the only railway
woman in France, came by her commercial knowledge
largely through instinct and inheritance. She gave
up literature at the Sorbonne for it, because as the
daughter of Philip Bornozi, from Constantinople,
who supplied rolling stock to the railways of the
Orient, France, and Belgium, the call to commerce
was in her blood. But except for the few specially
placed women like that, the way up in commerce
before the year 1914 was not plain and easy. Now
all over the world there are floating in on the morning
mail invitations like the one that has just come to
me from the New York University.</p>

<p>How much it means, I suppose no man can quite
understand. Suppose you, sir, were going to attempt
to talk glibly in terms of chiffon and voile and chambray
and all the rest of those mystifying terms that
tangle the tongue of a novice sent down the aisle of
a department store with a sample in his lower left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
hand vest pocket to be properly matched—you’d feel,
wouldn’t you, that a course in this positively unknown
tongue would be helpful in making yourself
and your errand rightly understood. Just so. Now
all unknown language is a handicap as is this one
to you, which is quite familiar to every woman, for
we learn to lisp in terms of our clothes. But on
the other hand, there are commercial terms which
you as a boy imbibed as naturally from your environment,
which are to your sister a foreign tongue. We
need the schools to teach it. And I am not sure but
it is the schools now being set up by the women who
have learned through their own experience that offer
the surest interpretation of the way in these new
paths in which women’s feet are set to-day.</p>

<p>Just off from Central Park West in New York
City, the Financial Centre for Women has been established
in direct response to the war demand. Wall
Street asked for it. Already 60 young women instructed
in practical banking, investments, accountancy,
and managerial duties have been sent out to
fill responsible positions in the National Bank of
Commerce, Morgan’s, the Federal Reserve and over
half a dozen other of the leading banks of New York
City. These young women have been given an intimate
working knowledge of such mysteries as stop
payments and certified checks, gold imports, cumulative
and preferred shares and all the intricacies
of the market and the terms in which “the street”
talks. In the room with the green cloth covered
table, about which sit these future financiers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
captains of industry in training, there is a blackboard.
See the chalk marked diagram. By the
routes mapped out in those white lines, they have
brought furs from Russia, wheat from Canada, sugar
from Hawaii. And all the money transactions involved
have been properly put through. Thoroughly
familiarised like this with international operations,
there is more to learn for the making of a financier.
I doubt if any but a woman would think to teach it.
Miss Elizabeth Rachel Wylie, who directs the Financial
Centre, recalls her classes from the wide world of
affairs through which they circle the globe, for personal
instruction. They have now the groundwork
of the knowledge with which a business man is familiar.
And Miss Wylie adds earnestly, impressively
the last lesson: “Don’t darn.”</p>

<p>You see, captains of industry don’t. Even so
much as an office boy who aspires to become a captain
of industry doesn’t. And the woman in the office
who spends her evenings mending her stockings and
washing her handkerchiefs, misses, say, the moving
pictures where the man in the office is adding to his
stock of general information. This tendency to revert
to type has been the fatal handicap of the past.
By the faint beginnings of an intention to discard it,
you differentiate the new woman in commerce from
her predecessor the business woman. By way of
discipline that girl there at the green cloth covered
table, whose bag of war knitting hangs on the back
of her chair the while she’s shipping furs from Russia,
will leave it at home to-morrow. Cecile Bornozi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
wouldn’t have done a million dollars’ worth of
business with the French Government the past year
if she had stopped to knit. And if her thoughts
had been on her stockings, she might have missed important
details in railway rolling stock. In her room
at the Hotel Savoy in London, I never saw a needle
or thimble or spool of thread. But on her table I
noticed <em>System</em>, the magazine of business.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">APPROACHING HIGH FINANCE IN FRANCE</p>

<p>Over on the banks of the Seine even as here on
the banks of the Hudson, they are teaching women
now the things that Cecile Bornozi knows. Not so
long ago I stood in the École Pratique de Haut Enseignement
Commercial pour les Jeunes Filles in
Paris. This practical school of high commercial instruction
for young girls is in the Rue Saint Martin
in an old monastery, the Ancien Prieure de Saint
Martin des Champs, where the Government has given
them quarters. Here a high vaulted room of prayer
has been turned into an amphitheatre. On rows of
benches lifted tier after tier above the grey and
white tiled floor, a hundred and twenty-five girls sat
facing a new future. For the first time in history,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la jeune fille</i> who has always been more domestic
minded than the young girl of any other nation except
Germany, is being taught to be commercially
minded. Curiously enough, “Thou shalt not darn”
is a fundamental precept for success laid down by the
director of the new school in France even as at the
new school in America. <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua in Paris has to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
be perhaps even more insistent about it than Miss
Wylie in New York. These are 125 girls of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoise</i> families, any one of whom, if the great
war had not come about, would be this morning going
to market with her mother to learn the relative values
of the different varieties of soup greens. And this
afternoon she would be occupied, needle in hand, on
a chemise or a robe <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de nuit</i> for her trousseau. Now
she has been called to a totally new environment.
Here she sits on a wooden bench, the sofa pillow she
has brought with her at her back, a fountain pen in
hand, her note book on her knee, adjusting herself to
a career which up to 1914 no one so much as dreamed
of for her. She is hearing this morning a lecture on
commercial law, delivered by <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Suzanne Grinberg,
one of Paris’ famous lawyers. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Professeur</i>
sits on a high stool before a great walnut table, her
shapely hands in graceful gesture accentuating her
legal phrases. Every little while you catch the
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n’est ce pas?</i>” with which she closes a period.
And now and then she turns to the blackboard behind
her to illustrate her meaning with a diagram.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua passes the school catalogue for my
inspection and I notice a course of study that includes:
industrial trade marks, designs, etc.; foreign
commercial legislation; commercial documents, buying
and selling, banking, etc.; bookkeeping, commercial
and financial arithmetic; course in merchandising,
including textiles, dyes, etc.; political economy,
including the distribution of wealth, the monetary
systems of the world, the consumption of wealth;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
pauperism, insurance, and charities; the state and its
rôle in the economic order, taxes, socialism; economic
geography and world markets; law, including public
law, civil law and laws relating to women; foreign
languages. This is the curriculum now being approached
by the young girl who up to yesterday had
nothing more serious in the world to occupy her
leisure than to sit at the window with an embroidery
frame in her lap watching and waiting for a husband.</p>

<p>But you see three years ago, four years ago, Pierre
marched by the window in a poilu’s blue uniform
and he may never come back. Marriage has hitherto
been the fixed fact of every French girl’s life.
Now numbers of women must inevitably, inexorably
find another career. These girls here are many of
them the daughters of professional men, doctors and
lawyers. The girl in the third row back with the
blue feather in her hat is the niece of President Poincaré.
That one with the pretty soft brown eyes in
the front row is married. The wife of a manufacturer
who is serving his country as a lieutenant in
the army, she is trying as best she may to take his
place at the head of the great industrial enterprise
he had to leave at a day’s notice when his call to the
colours came. She found herself confronted with
all sorts of difficult situations. Somehow she’s
managed so far by sheer force of will and somewhat
perhaps by intuition to come through some pretty
narrow situations. For the future she’s not willing
to take any more such chances. She has come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
learn all that a school has to teach of the scientific
principles and the established facts of commerce.
Two girls here are the granddaughters of one of the
leading merchants of the Havre. Their brother,
who was to have succeeded to the management of
the celebrated financial house, gave his life for his
country instead at the Marne. And these girls, with
the consent of the family, have dedicated their lives
to taking their brother’s place in the economic up-building
of France to which the financial world looks
forward after the war.</p>

<p>You see like this the new woman in commerce all
over the world is planning for a career that will
never again rest with stenography and typewriting.
Bringing furs from Russia and wheat from Canada
is more interesting. There is nothing like preparedness.
You are almost sure to do that for which you
have specially made ready. And one glance at the
programme of study for the École Pratique de Haut
Enseignement Commercial shows clearly enough to
any one who reads, that it is what Cecile Bornozi
with her flashing glance calls the “big venture”
which is the ultimate aim of this girl with the new
note book on her knee. Meantime France can
scarcely wait for her to complete her training.
<abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua has almost to stand at the door of the
Ancien Prieure to turn away the employers who
come to the Rue <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin to offer positions to her
pupils. “Always they are asking,” she says, “have
I any more graduates ready?”</p>

<p>Avocat Suzanne Grinberg’s soft musical voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
goes on in the amphitheatre expounding commercial
law. Outside in her adjoining office, the little stone
walled room with the religious Gothic window,
<abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua tells me how it has come about, this
new attitude on the part of her country to women
who are going to find economic independence in the
business world. In the cold little room in a war
burdened land where coal is $80 a ton, we draw
our chairs closer to the tiny grate. <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua
leans forward and selects two fagots to be added
to the fire that must be carefully conserved with
rigid war-time economy.</p>

<p>As she begins to talk, I catch the look in her eyes,
the glow of idealism that I have felt somewhere
before. Where? Ah, yes. It was Frau Anna von
Wunsch in whose eyes I have seen the gleam that
flashed the same feminist message. Frau von
Wunsch was before the war the presedient of <span lang="de">Die
Frauenbanck</span>. This was for Germany a most revolutionary
institution that hung out its gold lettered
sign at 39 Motzstrasse, Berlin, a woman’s bank in
a land where it was contrary to custom for a married
woman to be permitted to do any banking at all.
But “Women will never become a world power until
they become a money power,” said Frau von
Wunsch. And they put that motto in black letters
on all of their letter heads and checks. The armies
of the world are now entrenched between the Seine
and the Rhine and since 1914 of course hardly any
personal word at all has come through the censored
lines from the feminists of Germany to the feminists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
of France. One does not even know what has become
of Frau von Wunsch and her Frauenbanck over
there in Mittel Europa. But the ideal that she
lighted, flames now in every land.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua’s plan too is for a new woman in
commerce who shall be a money power and a world
power. And perhaps it may be France that is temperamentally
fitted to lead all lands in achieving
that ideal. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune fille</i>, so carefully trained for
domesticity only, has been known to develop wonderful
business qualities after marriage. Invariably
in the small shops of France it is Madame who presides
at her husband’s cash drawer. A woman’s
hand has led industries for which France is world
famous: <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Pommerey whose champagne is
chosen by the epicure in every land, <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Paquin
whose house has dictated clothes for the women of
all countries, and <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Duval whose restaurants
are on nearly every street corner of Paris. The
commercial instinct is really latent in every French
woman. There is scarcely a French household in
which a husband making an investment of any kind
does not first consult with his wife. This birthright
then, why not develop it by training and add scientific
knowledge to intuition?</p>

<p>That was the proposition with which the French
Minister of Commerce was approached at the beginning
of the war. It was his own daughter who
came to the Bureau of State over which he presided,
with a new programme. <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Valentine Thomson
is the editor of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vie Feminine</i>, in whose columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
she had already advocated wider business opportunities
for women on the ground that France would
have need of women in many new capacities. Now
she came to ask that the High Schools of Commerce
throughout the land should be opened to girls.
Hitherto they had been exclusively for boys. The
Minister of Commerce took the matter under consideration.
The argument that girls should be prepared
for responsibilities that every year of war
would more surely bring to them sounded to him
logical enough. Besides <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Valentine Thomson
is a daughter with a most pretty and persuading way,
a way that is as helpful to a feminist as to any other
woman. So it happened that the Minister of Commerce,
in September, 1915, issued a circular recommending
the opening of the national Schools of Commerce
to women. The Ministry could only recommend.
Each Chamber of Commerce could ultimately
decide for its own city. And there were but
three cities in which the final court of authority refused,
Paris, Lyons and Marseilles.</p>

<p>Then in Paris <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua decided that women
too must somehow have their chance. She had already
organised her countrywomen in the Federation
of French Toy Makers, for which she has far-flung
ambitions. This new industry which she is putting
on its feet in France, she has planned shall supplant
the made-in-Germany toys in the markets of the
world. But the women who are handling the industry
must know how on more than a domestic
scale. And Paris, the metropolis of France, offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
them no commercial training. In the spring of
1916 <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua decided to go to the Department
of State about the matter. There the Minister of
Commerce, M. Thomson, furrowed his brow:
“After all, Mademoiselle,” he said, “have women
the mentality for business? The Ministry of War
has opened employment in its offices to women.
And these girls now whom the Government has admitted
to clerkships here, some of them seem quite
useless. Mademoiselle,” he added wearily, “is a
woman’s brain really capable for commerce?”</p>

<p>“Train it. Then try it. What we need is
schools,” said <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua.</p>

<p>A few moments later the conversation turned on
the toy industry. “What do you know about the
toy industry?” asked the Minister of State curiously.
She told him. And as the woman talked,
his wonder grew. She did know about toys, that
which would enable the French to defeat the Germans
in this branch of commerce after the other defeat
is finished. Would <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Sanua give a lecture
on the toy industry before the Association Nationale
d’Expansions Economique? And would she
make a report before the Conference Economique des
Allies? Which she did. So here was a woman
who had a brain worth while for commerce. Well,
there might be others. If the Chamber of Commerce
in Paris was still doubtful, the Ministry of
Commerce would take a chance on endorsing <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>.
Sanua’s proposal. They secured for her the Ancien
Prieure. And she established the school for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
she gives her services. She has gathered a faculty
which includes celebrated names in France, most
of whom are serving without compensation. Three
former Ministers of Commerce form part of the committee
of patronage for the school. And the first
diplomas last June were conferred by a state official,
the Inspector General of Education. For France is
arriving at the conclusion that she will have need of
trained women as well as such men as she can muster
for the great economic conflict that is going to follow
when the other battle flags are furled.</p>

<p>So here at the Ancien Prieure 125 new women are
coming into commerce. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N’est ce pas?</i>” I hear
Avocat Suzanne Grinberg’s voice repeat. <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>.
Sanua adds another fagot to the fire. Again as she
looks up her eyes are illumined with the ideal that
animates her in the service in which she is now engaged
for her country. I think the women of
France will be a money power and a world power.</p>

<p>See them starting on the way. Already the Bank
of France to-day has 700 women employés, the
Credit Foncier has 400, and the Credit Lyonnaise
has 1200 women employés. Clerical positions in
all the government departments, including the War
Office, have been opened to women. M. Metin, the
under secretary of the French Ministry of Finance,
has recently appointed <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>. Jeanne Tardy an attaché
of his department, the first time in the history
of France that a woman has held such a position.</p>

<p>Now in every country this same movement has
taken place. Russia has had women clerks at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
War Office, the Ministries of the Interior, Agriculture,
Education, Transportation, and at the Chancelleries
of the Imperial Court and Crown Property.
The Imperial Russian Bank employed women by
preference.</p>

<p>In the German government bureaus and offices,
the women employés outnumber the men and they
are to be found now in every bank in Germany.
There are even new women in commerce in Germany
conducting business houses that soldier husbands
have left in their hands, who are beginning
openly to rebel against the restriction which excludes
women along with “idiots, bankrupts, and dishonest
traders” from the Bourse in Berlin. And recently a
petition has been addressed to the Reichstag for the
removal of this bar sinister in business.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">MOVING ON LONDON’S FINANCIAL DISTRICT</p>

<p>Probably the largest invasion of the business office,
whether that of the government or of the private
employer, has taken place in England. No
less than 278,000 women have directly replaced in
commerce men released for military duty. Petticoats
in the district that is known as the “city,” I
suppose are as unprecedented as they could be anywhere
in the world. The most visionary, advanced
feminist, who before 1914 might have timidly suggested
such an invasion, would have been curtly dismissed
with, “It isn’t done.” And in truth I believe
it never would have been done without a war.
Down in Fenchurch Avenue, in the great shipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
district, I was told: “Really, don’t you know, this
is the last place we ever expected to see women.
But they are here.”</p>

<p>The gentleman who spoke might have come out
of a page of “Pickwick Papers.” His silk hat hung
on a nail in the wall above his desk. And he wore
a black Prince Albert coat. He looked over his
gold bowed eye glasses out into the adjoining room
at the clerical staff of the Orient Steamship Company
of which he has charge. He indicated for my
inspection among the grey haired men on the high
stools, rows of women on stools specially made
higher for their convenience. And he spoke in the
tone of voice in which a geologist might refer to
some newly discovered specimen.</p>

<p>It was withal a very kindly voice and there was
in it a distinct note of pride when he said: “Now
I want you to see a journal one of my girls has
done.” He came back with it and as he turned the
pages for my inspection, he commented: “I find
the greatest success with those who at 17 or 18 come
direct from school, ‘fresh off the arms,’ as we say in
Scotland. They, well, they know their arithmetic
better. My one criticism of women employés is that
some of them are not always quite strong on figures.
And they lack somewhat in what I might call staying
power. Business is business and it must go on every
day. Now and then my girls want to stay home for
a day. And the long hours, 9:30 to 5:00 in the city,
well, I suppose they are arduous for a woman.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Clarke,” I said, “may I ask you a question:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
What preparation have these new employés had for
business?”</p>

<p>And it turns out, as a matter of fact, most of them
haven’t had any. A large number of this quarter
of a million women who came at the call of the
London Board of Trade to take the places of men
in the offices, are of the class who since they were
“finished” at school, have been living quiet English
lives in pleasant suburbs where the rose trees grow
and everybody strives to be truly a lady who doesn’t
descend to working for money. It is difficult for an
American woman of any class to visualise such an
ideal. But it was a British fact. There were thousands
of correct English girls like this, whose pulses
had never thrilled to a career who are finding it now
suddenly thrust upon them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clarke,” I said, “suppose a quarter of a
million men were to be hastily turned loose in a
kitchen or nursery to do the work to which women
have been born and trained for generations. Perhaps
they might not be able to handle the job with
just the precision of their predecessors. Now do
you think they would?”</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke raised his commercial hand in a quick
gesture of protest: “Dear lady,” he said, “I remember
when my wife once tried me out one day in the
nursery—one day was enough for her and for me—I,
well, I wasn’t equal to the strain. Frankly, I’m
quite sure most men wouldn’t have the staying power
for the tasks you mention.”</p>

<p>So you see, in comparison, perhaps the new women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
on the high stools that have been specially made to
their size, are doing pretty well anyhow. There are
73,000 more of them in government offices, the
lower clerkships in the civil service having been
opened to them since the war. And no less than
42,000 more women have replaced men in finance
and banking.</p>

<p>Really, it was like taking the last trench in the
Great Push when the women’s battalions arrived at
Lombard and Threadneedle streets. That bulwark
of the conservatism of the ages, the Bank of England,
even, capitulates. And the woman movement
has swept directly past the resplendent functionary
in the red coat and bright brass buttons who walks
up and down before its outer portals like something
the receding centuries forgot and left behind on the
scene. He still has the habit of challenging so much
as a woman visitor. It is a hold-over perhaps from
the strenuous days of that other woman movement
when every government institution had to be barricaded
against the suffragettes, and your hand bag
was always searched to see if you carried a bomb.
But the bright red gentleman is more likely to let
you by now than before 1914.</p>

<p>Inside, as you penetrate the innermost recesses,
you will go past glass partitioned doors through
which are to be seen girls’ heads bending over the
high desks. And you will meet girl clerks with
ledgers under their arms hurrying across court yards
and in and out and up and down all curious, winding,
musty passage ways. I know of nowhere in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
world that you feel the solemn significance of the
new woman movement more than here as you catch
the echo of these new footsteps on stone floors where
for hundreds of years no woman’s foot has ever trod
before.</p>

<p>The Bank of England isn’t giving out the figures
about the number of its women employés. An official
just looks the other way and directs you down
the corridor to put the inquiry to another black
frock coat. O, well, if that’s the way they feel
about it! Others with less ivy on the walls may
speak. The London and Southwestern Bank which
before the war employed but two women, and these
stenographers, now has 900 women. One of London’s
greatest banks, the London, City and Midland,
has among 3000 employés 2600 women. The new
woman in commerce is emerging in England and
these are some of the verdicts on her efficiency:</p>

<p>Bank of England: “We find the women quick
at writing, slow at figures. We have been surprised
to find that they do as well as they do. But they
are not so efficient as men.”</p>

<p>London, City and Midland Bank: “For accuracy,
willingness, and attention to duty, we may say
that women employés excel.”</p>

<p>Morgan and Grenfells: “We employ women on
ledger work. But we find they lack the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> of men. And they don’t like to work after
hours.”</p>

<p>Barclay’s Bank: “We cannot speak too highly
of our women clerks. They have shown great zeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
to acquire a knowledge of the necessary details.”</p>

<p>London and Southwestern Bank: “Women employés
are even more faithful and steady than men.
But when there is a sudden rush of work, as say at
the end of the year, they go into hysterics. We find
that we cannot let them see the work piled up.
It must be given out to them gradually. This, I
think, is due to inexperience. When women have
had the same length of experience and the same
training as men, we see no reason why they should
not be equally as capable.”</p>

<p>Now that’s about the way the evidence runs.
You would probably get it about like that anywhere
in Europe. There is some criticism. Isn’t it surprising
that there is not more when you remember
that it is mostly raw recruits chosen by chance whose
services are being compared with the picked men
whom they have replaced? In England in 1915
the Home Office moved to provide educational facilities
for women for their new commercial responsibilities.
There was appointed its Clerical and
Business Occupations Committee which opened in
London, and requested the mayors of all other cities
similarly to open, emergency training classes for
giving a ground work in commercial knowledge and
office routine. These government training courses
cover a period of from three to ten weeks. It is
rather sudden, isn’t it, three weeks’ preparation for
a job in preparation for which the previous incumbent
had years?</p>

<p>And there are thousands of the women who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
gone into the offices without even that three weeks’
training. The cousin of the wife of the head of
the firm knew of some woman of “very good family”
whose supporting man was now enlisted and who
must therefore earn her own living. Or some other
woman was specially recommended as needing work.
And there was another method of selection: “She
had such nice manners and she was such a pretty
little thing I liked her at once, don’t you know.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WHAT EVERY WOMAN KNOWS</p>

<p>’Um, yes, I do know. Somewhere in America
once there was an editorial chief who said to me,
his assistant, “Now I need a secretary. There’ll be
some here to-day to answer my advertisement.
Won’t you see them and let me know about their
qualifications.” There were, as I remember, some
fourteen of them, grey haired and experienced ones,
technically expert and highly recommended ones,
college trained ones, and one was a dimpled little
thing with pink cheeks and eyes of baby blue. My
detailed report was quite superfluous. Through the
open door, as I entered his office, the chief had one
glance: “That one,” he said eagerly, “that little
peach at the end of the row. She’s the one I want.”</p>

<p>Like that, little peaches are getting picked in all
languages. And after them are the others fresh
from the gardens where the rose trees grow. And
among these ornamental companions of her employer’s
selection, the really useful employé who gets in,
finds herself at a disadvantage. The little peach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
“bears” the whole woman’s wage market. She has
hysterics: all the wise commercial world shakes its
head about the staying power of woman in business.
And the whole female of the species gets listed on
the pay roll at two-thirds man’s pay.</p>

<p>The Orient Steamship Company, I believe, is giving
equal pay for equal work. To an official of
another steamship company complaining of the inefficiency
of women employés, Sir Kenneth Anderson,
President of the Orient Line, put the query,
“How much do you pay them?” “Twenty-five
shillings a week,” was the answer. “Then you
don’t deserve to have efficient women,” was the
prompt retort. “We pay those who prove competent
up to three pounds a week. And they’re such
a success we’ve decided we can’t let them go after
the war.” But Sir Kenneth Anderson is the son of
one of England’s pioneer feminists, Dr. Elizabeth
Garrett Anderson, and the nephew of another, Mrs.
Millicent Garrett Fawcett, president of the National
Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies. And
I suppose there isn’t another business house in London
that has the Orient Steamship Company’s vision.
Women clerks in London business circles generally
are getting twenty shillings to thirty shillings a
week. The city of Manchester, advertising for
women clerks for the public health offices, offered
salaries respectively of ten shillings, eighteen shillings
and twenty shillings a week, “candidates to sit
for examination.”</p>

Who, at the Ancien Prieure in Paris, holds open the door of
commerce for women in France.</p>
</div>

<p>Little peaches might not be worth more, it is true.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>The troubled French minister was probably right
when he complained that some of his new office force
were quite useless. But there is a Federation of
University women in England with perfectly good
University degrees attesting mathematical proficiency.
They say, however, that they cannot live
on less than a minimum wage of three pounds a
week. Awhile ago in Italy a group of women accountants
were asked by the Administration of Public
Instruction to replace men called to the front.
With exactly the same academic licenses as men,
they were nevertheless offered but two-thirds men’s
pay. And they declined the proffered positions.
Nor is it only England or Italy or Russia or France
that presents this ratio between the wages of men
and those of women in the business offices. The
first resolution adopted by the new Women’s Association
of Commerce of America was one demanding
equal pay for equal work. Eventually the Women’s
Association of Commerce and the Financial Centre
for Women and the École Pratique de Haut
Enseignement Commercial may succeed in cultivating
in the commercial world a taste for a higher type
of employé than the little peaches of the past. But
for the present it is the handicap that the business
woman in routine office positions has to accept.
And there is no Trade Union in commerce to care.
Can you manage to give equal work on two-thirds
man’s pay?</p>

<p>If you can, this is the hour of your opportunity.
The women’s battalions are with every month of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
war drawing nearer, moving onward toward the
president’s office. The London and Southwestern
Bank has advanced 200 of its women clerks to the
cashier’s window. The London City and Midland
Bank a year ago promoted a woman to the position
of manager of one of its branches. It was the first
time that a woman in England had held such a position.
Newspaper reporters were hurriedly despatched
to Sir Edward Holden, the president, to see
about it. But he only smilingly affirmed the truth
of the rumour that had spread like wildfire through
the city. It was indeed so. And he had no less
than thirty more women making ready for similar
positions.</p>

<p>Over in France at Bordeaux and at Nancy in
both cities the first class graduated from the High
School of Commerce after the admission of women,
had a woman leading in the examinations. In the
same year, 1916, a girl had carried off the first honours
in the historic Gilbart Banking Lectures in
London. I suppose no other event could have more
profoundly impressed financial circles. The <cite>Banker’s
Magazine</cite> came out with Rose Esther Kingston’s
portrait in a half page illustration and the announcement
that a new era in banking had commenced. It
was the first time that women had been admitted to
the lectures. There were some sixty-two men candidates
who presented themselves for examination
at the termination of the two months’ course. Rose
Kingston, who outstripped them all, had been for a
year a stenographer in the correspondence department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of the Southwestern Bank. Now she was invited
to the cashier’s desk.</p>

<p>To correctly estimate the achievement, it should
be remembered that the men with whom she competed,
had years of commercial background and this
girl had practically one year. There were so many
technical terms with which they were as familiar as
she is with all the varieties of voile. What was the
meaning of “allonge”? she asked three of her fellow
employés bending over their ledgers before she found
one who was willing to make it clear that this was
the term for the piece of paper attached to a bill of
exchange. Fragment by fragment like this, she
picked up her banking knowledge. Once the Gilbart
lecturer mentioned the “Gordon Case,” with
which every man among his hearers was quite familiar.
She searched through three volumes to get
an intelligent understanding of the reference.
Meantime, I think she did “darn” nights. You see,
her salary was thirty shillings a week.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE NEW WOMAN AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS</p>

<p>This is for the feminine mind the besetting temptation
most difficult to avoid. Can we give up our
“darning” and all of the habits of domesticity which
the word connotes? It is the question which women
face the world over to-day. Success beckons now
along the broad highway of commerce. But the
difficult details of living detain us on the way to
fame or fortune. And we’ve got to cut the apron-strings
that tie us to yesterday if we would go ahead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Which shall it be, new woman or old? Most of us
either in business or the professions cannot be both.
Dr. Ella Flagg Young, widely known as the first
woman to so arrive at the top of her profession as
Superintendent of Schools in the city of Chicago,
received a salary of $10,000 a year. She had made
it the inviolable rule of her life to live as comfortably
as a man. She told me that she did not permit
her mind to be distracted from her work for any of
the affairs of less moment that she could hire some
one else to attend to. She did not so much as buy
her own gloves. Her housekeeper-companion attended
to all of her shopping. And never, she said,
even when she was a $10 a week school teacher,
had she darned her own stockings!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are a few women who have, it is true, managed
to achieve success in spite of the handicap of
domestic duties. But they must be women of exceptional
physique to stand the strain. I know a
business woman in New York who, at the head of
a department of a great life insurance company, enjoys
an income of $20,000 a year. Yet that woman
still does up with her own hands all of the preserves
that are used in her household. Her husband, who
is a physician with a most lucrative practice, you
will note doesn’t do preserves. He wouldn’t if the
family never had them.</p>

<p>A woman who is a member of the New York law
firm of which her husband is the other partner was
with him spending last summer at their country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
place. She, during their “vacation,” put up a hundred
cans of fruit. I think it was between strawberry
time and blackberry time that she had to return
to town to conduct a case in court. She had cautioned
her husband that while she was gone, he be
sure to “see about” the little green cucumbers. But,
of course, he didn’t. What heed does a man—and
he happens also to be a judge of one of the higher
courts—give to little green cucumbers? Long after
they should have been picked, they had grown to be
large and yellow, which, as any woman knows, takes
them way past their pickling prime. That was how
the woman who cared about little green cucumbers
found them, when she returned from the city. In
despair she threw them all out on the ground. The
next day, turning the pages of her cook book, she
happened to discover another use for yellow cucumbers.
Putting on a blue gingham sunbonnet, she
went out to the field back of the orchard and laboriously
gathered them all up again. And she could
not rest until on the shelf in her farm house cellar
stood three stone crocks filled with sweet cucumber
pickle. She just couldn’t bear to see those cucumbers
go to waste. It is the sense of thrift inculcated
by generations of forbears whose occupation was
the practice of housewifery.</p>

<p>The Judge doesn’t have any such feeling about
pickles or any other household affairs. When he
goes home at night, he reads or smokes or plays billiards.
When the lady who is his law partner goes
home, even though their New York residence is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
an apartment hotel, she finds many duties to engage
her attention. The magazines on the table would
get to be as ancient as those in a dentist’s office if
she didn’t remove the back numbers. Who else
would conduct the correspondence that makes and
breaks dinner engagements and do it so gracefully
as to maintain the family’s perfect social balance?
Who else would indite with an appropriate sentiment
and tie up and address all the Christmas packages
that have to be sent annually to a large circle
of relatives? Well, all these and innumerable other
things you may be sure the Judge wouldn’t do. He
simply can’t be annoyed with petty and trivial matters.
He says that for the successful practice of his
profession, he requires outside of his office hours rest
and relaxation. Now the other partner practises
without them. And you can see which is likely to
make the greater legal reputation.</p>

<p>In upper Manhattan, at a Central Park West address,
a woman physician’s sign occupies the front
window of a brown stone front residence. She happens
to be a friend of mine. Katherine is one of
the most successful women practitioners in New
York. Nine patients waited for her in the ante
room the last time I was there. From the basement
door, inadvertently left ajar, there floated up the
sound of the doctor’s voice: “That chicken,” she
was saying, “you may cream for luncheon. I have a
case at the hospital at two o’clock. We’ll hang the
new curtains in the dining-room at three. And—well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
I’ll be down again before I start out this
morning.”</p>

<p>I know the Doctor so well that I can tell you
pretty accurately what were the other domestic
duties that had already received her attention. She
has a most wonderful kitchen. She had glanced
through it to see that the sink was clean and that
each shining pot and pan was hanging on its own
hook. She had given the order for the day to the
butcher. She had planned the dinner for the evening,
probably with a soup to utilise the remnants
of Sunday’s roast. Then—I have known it to happen—some
one perhaps called, “O, say, dear, here’s
a button coming loose. Could you, ’er, just spare
the time?”</p>

<p>Well, ultimately she stands in the doorway of her
office with her calm, pleasant “This way, please” to
the first patient, and turns her attention to the diagnosis,
we will say, of an appendicitis case. Meanwhile,
down the front staircase a carefree gentleman
has passed on his way to the doorway of the other
office. He is the doctor whose sign is in the other
front window of this same brown stone residence.
What has he been doing in the early morning hours
before taking up his professional duties for the day?
His sole employment has been the reading of the
morning newspaper! Katherine never interrupts
him in that. It is one of the ways she has been such
a successful wife. She learned the first year of their
marriage how important he considered concentration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">MAN’S EASY WAY TO FAME</p>

<p>Now you can see that there’s a difference in being
these two doctors. And it’s a good deal easier being
the doctor who doesn’t have to sew on his own buttons
and who needs take less thought than the birds
of the air about his breakfasts and his luncheons and
his dinners, how they shall be ordered for the day.
That’s the way every man I know in business or the
professions has the bothersome details of living all
arranged for him by some one else. I noted recently
a business man who was thus speeded on his way to
his office from the moment of his call to breakfast.
The breakfast table was perfectly appointed. “Is
your coffee all right, dear?” his wife inquired solicitously.
It was. As it always is. The eggs placed
before him had been boiled just one and a half minutes
by the clock. He has to have them that way,
and by painstaking insistence she has accomplished
it with the cook. The muffins were a perfect golden
brown. He adores perfection and in every detail
she studies to attain it for him. The breakfast that
he had finished was a culinary achievement. “Don’t
forget your sanatogen, dear,” she cautioned as he
folded his napkin. “Honey, you fix it so much better
than I can,” he suggested in the persuasive tone
of voice that is his particular charm. She hastily
set down her coffee cup and rose from the table to
do it. Then she selected a white carnation from the
centrepiece vase and pinned it in his buttonhole.
He likes flowers. She picked up his gloves from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
hall table, and discovering a tiny rip, ran lightly upstairs
to exchange them for another pair, while he
passed round the breakfast table, hat in hand, kissing
the five children in turn. Then he kissed her too
and went swinging down the front walk to catch the
last commuters’ train.</p>

<p>I happened to see him go that morning. But it’s
always like that. And when she welcomes him
home at night, smiling on the threshold there, the
five children are all washed and dressed and in good
order, with their latest quarrel hushed to cherubic
stillness. The newest magazine is on the library
table beneath the softly shaded reading lamp, and a
carefully appointed dinner waits. All of the wearisome
domestic details of existence he has to be
shielded from. For he is a captain of industry.</p>

<p>There are even more difficult men. I know of
one who writes. He has to be so protected from the
rude environment of this material world that while
the muse moves him, his meals carefully prepared
by his wife’s own hands, because she knows so well
what suits his sensitive digestion, are brought to his
door. She may not speak to him as she passes in
the tray. No servant is ever permitted to do the
cleaning in his sanctum. It disturbs the “atmosphere,”
he says. So his wife herself even washes
the floor. Hush! His last novel went into the
sixth edition. He’s a genius. And his wife says,
“You have to take every care of a man who possesses
temperament. He’s so easily upset.” For the lack
of a salad just right, a book might have failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span></p>

<p>’Er, do you know of any genius of the feminine
gender for whom the gods arrange such happy auspices
as that? Is there any one trying to be a prominent
business or professional woman for whom the
wrinkles are all smoothed out of the way of life as
for the prominent professional man whom I have
mentioned?</p>

<p>We who sat around a dinner table not long ago
knew of no such fortunate women among our acquaintance.
That dinner, for instance, hadn’t appointed
itself. Our hostess, a magazine editor, had
hurried in breathless haste from her office at fifteen
minutes of six to take up all of the details that
demand the “touch of a woman’s hand.” The penetrating
odour of a roast about to burn had greeted
her as she turned her key in the hall door. She
rushed to the oven and rescued that. Two of the
napkins on the table didn’t match the set. Marie,
the maid, apologetically thought they would “do.”
They didn’t. It was the magazine editor who
reached into the basket of clean laundry for the right
ones and ironed them herself because Marie had to
be busy by this time with the soup. The flowers
hadn’t come. She telephoned the florist. He was
so sorry. But she had ordered marguerites, and
there weren’t any that day. Yes, if roses would
answer instead, certainly he would send them at
once. The bon bons in yellow she found set out on
the sideboard in a blue dish. Why weren’t they in
the dish of delicate Venetian glass of which she was
particularly fond? Well, because the dish of delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Venetian glass had gone the way of so many
delicate dishes, down the dumb waiter shaft an hour
ago. Marie didn’t mean to break it, as she assured
her mistress by dissolving in tears for some five minutes
while more important matters waited. A particular
sauce for the dessert depending on the delicacy
of its flavouring, the editor must make herself.
Well—after everything was all right, it was a composed
and unperturbed and smiling hostess who extended
the welcome to her invited company.</p>

<p>The guest of honour was a woman playwright
whose problem play was one of the successes of last
season. She has just finished another. That was
why she could be here to-night. While she writes,
no dinner invitation can lure her from her desk.
“You see, I just have to do my work in the evening,”
she told us. “After midnight I write best. It’s the
only time I am sure that no one will interrupt with
the announcement that my cousin from the West is
here, or the steam pipes have burst, or some other
event has come to pass in a busy day.”</p>

<p>We had struck the domestic chord. Over the coffee
we discussed a book that has stirred the world
with its profound contribution to the interpretation
of the woman movement. The author easily holds
a place among the most famous. We all know her
public life. One who knew her home life, told us
more. She wrote that book in the intervals of doing
her own housework. The same hand that held her
inspired pen, washed the dishes and baked the bread
and wielded the broom at her house—and made all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
of her own clothes. It was necessary because her
entire fortune had been swept away. Does any one
know of a man who has made a profound contribution
to literature the while he prepared three meals
a day or in the intervals of his rest and recreation
cut out and made, say, his own shirts? I met last
year in London this famous woman who has compassed
all of these tasks on her way to literary fame.
She’s in a sanitarium trying to recuperate from nervous
prostration.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS</p>

<p>The hand that knows how to stir with a spoon and
to sew with a needle has got to forget its cunning if
women are to live successfully and engage in business
and the professions. The woman of the present
generation has struggled to do her own work in the
office and, after hours that of the woman of yesterday
in the home. It’s two days’ work in one. It has
been decided by the scientific experts, you remember,
who found the women munition workers of England
attempting this, that it cannot be done consistently
with the highest efficiency in output. And the
Trade Unions in industry endorse the decision.</p>

<p>This is the critical hour for the new women in
commerce to accept the same principle. I know it
is difficult to adopt a man’s standard of comfortable
living on two-thirds a man’s pay. And I know of
no one to pin carnations in your buttonhole. But
somehow the woman in business has got to conserve
her energy and concentrate her force in bridging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
distance that has in the past separated her from
man’s pay. There is now the greatest chance that
has ever come to her to achieve it—if she prepares
herself by every means of self-improvement to perform
equal work. Don’t darn. Go to the moving
pictures even, instead.</p>

<p>For great opportunities wait. Lady Mackworth
of England, when her father, Lord Rhondda, was absent
on a government war mission in America recently,
assumed complete charge of his vast coal and
shipping interests. So successful was her business
administration, that on his resignation from the
chairmanship of the Sanatogen Company, she was
elected to fill his place. Like this the new woman
in commerce is going to take her seat at the mahogany
desk. Are you ready?</p>

<p>The New York newspapers have lately announced
the New York University’s advertisement in large
type: “Present conditions emphasise the opportunities
open to women in the field of business. Business
is not sentimental. Women who shoulder equal responsibilities
with men will receive equal consideration.
It is unnecessary to point out that training is
essential. The high rewards do not go to the unprepared.
Classes at the New York University are
composed of both men and women.”</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t they be? It is with madame at
his side that the thrifty shop keeper of France has
always made his way to success.</p>

<p>The terrible eternal purpose that flashes like zig-zag
lightning through the black war clouds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Europe, again appears. From the old civilisation
reduced to its elements on the battle fields, a new
world is slowly taking shape. And in it, the new
man and the new woman shall make the new money
power—together.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Taking Title in the Professions</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> are the grimmest outposts of all that mark
the winning of the woman’s cause. But they star
the map of Europe to-day—the Women’s War Hospitals.</p>

<p>Out of the night darkness that envelops a war-ridden
land, a bell sounds a faint alarm. From bed
to bed down the white wards there passes the word
in a hoarse whisper: “The convoy, the convoy
again.” Instantly the whole vast house of pain is
at taut attention. Boyish women surgeons, throwing
aside the cigarettes with which they have been relaxing
overstrained nerves, hastily don white tunics
and take their place by the operating tables.
Women physicians hurry from the laboratories with
the anesthetics that will be needed. Girl orderlies,
lounging at leisure in the corridors, remove their
hands from their pockets to seize the stretchers and
rush to their line-up in the courtyard. The gate
keeper turns a heavy iron key. From out the darkness
beyond, the convoy of grey ambulances reaching
in a continuous line from the railway station begins
to roll in.</p>

<p>On and on they come in great waves of agony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
lashed up by the latest seething storm of horror and
destruction out there on the front. In the dimmed
rays of the carefully hooded light at the entrance,
the girl chauffeur in khaki deftly swings into place
the great vehicle with her load of human freight. A
nurse in a flowing headdress, ghostly white against
the night, alights from the rear step. The wreckage
inside of what has been four men, now dead,
dying or maimed, is passed out. Groans and sharp
cries of pain mingle with the rasping of the motor as
the ambulance rolls on to make way for another.</p>

<p>The last drive in the trenches has been perhaps a
particularly terrible one. All night like this, every
night for a week, for two weeks, the rush for human
repairs may go on. Men broken on the gigantic
wheel of fate to which the world is lashed to-day
will be brought in like this, battalion after battalion
to be mended by women’s hands. The appalling
distress of a world in agony has requisitioned any
hands that know how, all hands with the skill to
bind up a wound.</p>

<p>It is very plain. You cannot stand like this in
a woman staffed hospital in the war zone without
catching a vision of the great moving picture spectacle
that here flashes through the smoke of battle.
Hush! From man’s extremity, it is, that the
Great Director of all is himself staging woman’s
opportunity.</p>

<p>The heights toward which the woman movement
of yesterday struggled in vain are taken at last.
The battle has been won over there in Europe. Between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the forces of the Allies and the Kaiser, it is,
that another fortress of ancient prejudice has fallen
to the waiting women’s legions. It was entirely unexpected,
entirely unplanned by any of the embattled
belligerents. Woman had been summoned to
industry. The proclamation that called her went
up on the walls of the cities almost as soon as the
call of the men to the colours. There were women
porters at the railway stations of Europe, women
running railroads, women driving motor vans,
women unloading ships, women street cleaners,
women navvies, women butchers, women coal heavers,
women building aeroplanes, women doing
danger duty in the T. N. T. factories of the arsenals,
and in every land women engaged in those 96 trades
and 1701 jobs in which the British War Office authoritatively
announced: “They have shown themselves
capable of successfully replacing the stronger
sex.”</p>

<p>Let the lady plough. Teach her to milk. She
can have the hired man’s place on the farm. She
can release the ten dollar a week clerk poring over
a ledger. She can make munitions. Her country
calls her. But the female constitution has not been
reckoned strong enough to sit on the judge’s bench.
And Christian lands unanimously deem it indelicate
for a woman to talk to God from a pulpit. From
the arduous duties of the professions, the world
would to the last professional man protect the
weaker sex.</p>

<p>Then, hark! Hear the Dead March again! As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
inexorably as in the workshops and the offices, it
began to echo through the seminaries and the colleges,
through the laboratories and the law courts.
Listen! The sound of marching feet. The new
woman movement is here too at the doors. High
on the walls of Leipzig and the Sorbonne, of Oxford
and Cambridge and Moscow and Milan, on all of
the old world institutions of learning, the long scrolls
of the casualty lists commenced to go up. Whole
cloisters and corridors began to be black with the
names of men “dead on the field of honour.” And
civilisation faced the inexorable sequel. Women at
last in the professions now are taking title on equal
terms with men.</p>

<p>The doors of a very old established institution in
Fifty-ninth Street, New York, swung open on a day
last autumn. And a line of young women passed
through. They went up the steps to take their place—for
the first time that women had ever been there—in
the class rooms of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons. There is perhaps a little awkward moment
of surprise, of curiosity. A professor nods in
recognition to the new comers. The class of 1921
smiles good naturedly. An incident is closed.</p>

<p>And an epoch is begun. Outside on a high scaffolding
there are masons and carpenters at work.
See them up there against a golden Indian summer
sky. They are putting the finishing touches on a
new $80,000 building addition. And the ringing of
their hammers and chisels, the scraping of their
trowels is but significant of larger building operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
on a stupendous scale not made by human
hands.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">A LOOK BACKWARD IN MEDICINE</p>

<p>This is the College of Physicians and Surgeons of
Columbia University, which after more than a hundred
years of history has decided to enlarge its accommodations
and add a paragraph to its catalog
announcing the admission of women. To understand
the significance of this departure from custom
and precedent we should recall the ostracism which
women have in the past been obliged to endure in
the medical profession. Elizabeth Blackwell, the
first woman of modern times in any land to achieve
a medical education, knocked in vain at the doors
of some twelve medical colleges of these United
States before one reluctantly admitted her. She
was graduated in 1849 at the Geneva Medical College
now a part of Syracuse University. The entrance
of this first woman into the medical profession
created such a stir that Emily Blackwell the second
woman to become a doctor, following in the footsteps
of her sister, found even more obstacles in her
path. The Geneva college having incurred the displeasure
of the entire medical fraternity now closed
its doors and refused to admit another woman.
Emily Blackwell going from city to city was at last
successful in an appeal to the medical college of
Cleveland, Ohio, which graduated her in 1852. So
great was the opposition now to women in the profession,
that it was clear that they must create their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
own opportunities for medical education. In turn
there were founded in 1850 the Philadelphia Medical
College for Women with which the name of
Ann Preston is associated as the first woman dean;
in 1853 the New York Infirmary to which in 1865
was added the Woman’s Medical College both institutions
founded by the Drs. Blackwell; in 1863
the New York Medical College and Hospital for
Women. “Females are ambitious to dabble in medicine
as in other matters with a view to reorganising
society,” sarcastically commented the <cite>Boston Medical
and Surgical Journal</cite>. Society as also the medical
profession coldly averted its face from these
pioneer women doctors.</p>

<p>“Good” women used to draw aside their skirts
when they passed Elizabeth Blackwell in church.
When she started in practice in New York City she
had to buy a house because no respectable residence
would rent her office room. Dr. Anna Manning
Comfort had her sign torn down in New York.
Druggists in Philadelphia refused to fill prescriptions
for Dr. Hannah Longshore. Girl medical
students were hissed and jeered at in hospital wards.
Men physicians were forbidden by the profession to
lecture in women’s colleges or to consult with women
doctors. Not until 1876 did the American Medical
Association admit women to membership. How
medical men felt about the innovation, which State
after State was now compelled to accept, was voiced
by the <cite>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</cite> of 1879
which said: “We regret to be obliged to announce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
that, at a meeting of the councillors held Oct. 1, it
was voted to admit women to the Massachusetts
Medical Society.”</p>

<p>Syracuse University, recovering from the censure
visited upon it for receiving Elizabeth Blackwell,
was the first of the coeducational institutions to welcome
women on equal terms with men to its medical
college. Other coeducational colleges in the West
later began to take them. In 1894 when Miss Mary
Garrett endowed Johns Hopkins University with
half a million dollars on condition that its facilities
for the study of medicine be extended to women
equally with men, a new attitude toward the woman
physician began to be manifest. From that time on,
she was going to be able with little opposition to get
into the medical profession. Her difficulty would
be to get up. Now no longer was a woman doctor
refused office facilities in the most fashionable residential
quarters in which she could pay the rent.
Her problem however was just that—to pay the
rent. A medical diploma doesn’t do it. And to
practise medicine successfully, therapeutically and
financially, without a hospital training and experience
is about as easy as to learn to swim without
going near the water. The most desirable opportunities
for this hospital experience were by the tacit
gentleman’s agreement in the profession quite generally
closed to women.</p>

<p>Until very recently, internships in general hospitals
were assigned almost exclusively to men. Dr.
Emily Dunnung Barringer in 1903 swung herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
aboard the padded seat in the rear of the Gouverneur
Hospital ambulance, the first woman to receive
an appointment as ambulance surgeon in New York
City. Twice before in competitive examinations
she had won such a place, but the commissioner of
public charities had declined to appoint her because
she was a woman. In 1908 another girl doctor, Dr.
Mary W. Crawford in a surgeon’s blue cap and coat
with a red cross on her sleeve, answered her first
emergency call as ambulance surgeon for Williamsburg
Hospital, Brooklyn. It happened this way:
the notification sent by the Williamsburg Hospital
to Cornell Medical College that year by some oversight
read that the examination for internship would
be open to “any member of the graduating class.”</p>

<p>When “M. W. Crawford” who had made application
in writing, appeared with a perfectly good
Cornell diploma in her hand, the authorities were
amazed. But they did not turn her away. They
undoubtedly thought as did one of the confident
young men applicants who said: “She hasn’t a
chance of passing. Being a girl is a terrible handicap
in the medical profession.” When she had
passed however at the head of the list of thirty-five
young men, the trustees endeavoured to get Dr. Mary
to withdraw. When she firmly declined to do so,
though they said it violated all established precedent,
they gave her the place. And a new era in medicine
had been inaugurated.</p>

<p>Here and there throughout the country, other
women now began to be admitted to examinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
for internships. They exhibited an embarrassing
tendency for passing at the head of the list. Any of
them were likely to do it. The only way out of the
dilemma, then was for the hospital authorities to
declare, as some did, that the institution had “no
accommodations for women doctors” which simply
meant that all of the accommodations had been assigned
to men. It is on this ground that Philadelphia’s
Blockley Hospital, the first large city almshouse
in the country to open to women the competitive
examination for internship, again and again
refused the appointment even to a woman who had
passed at the head of the list. It was 1914 before
Bellevue in New York City found a place for
the woman intern: five women were admitted among
the eighty-three men of the staff.</p>

<p>This unequal distribution of professional privileges
was the indication of a lack of professional fellowship
far reaching in consequences. Among the
exhibits in the laboratories to-day, there is a glass
bottle containing a kidney preserved in alcohol. In
all the annals of the medical profession, I believe,
there has seldom been another kidney just like it.
For some reason or other, too technical for a layman
to understand, it is a very wonderful kidney. Now
it happens that a young woman physician discovered
the patient with that kidney and diagnosed it. A
woman surgeon operated on that kidney and removed
it successfully. Then a man physician came along
and borrowed it and read a paper on it at a medical
convention. He is now chronicled throughout the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
medical fraternity with the entire credit for the
kidney.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t his. It’s our kidney,” I heard the
girl doctor say with flashing eyes. “You’ll take it
easier than that when you’re a little older, my dear,”
answered the woman surgeon who had lived longer
in the professional atmosphere that is so chilling to
ambition.</p>

<p>It was against handicaps like this that the women
in medicine were making progress. Dr. Gertrude B.
Kelly’s name, in New York, is at the top in the annals
of surgery. Dr. Bertha Van Hoesen is a famous
surgeon in Chicago. Dr. Mary A. Smith and
Dr. Emma V. P. Culbertson are leading members
of the medical profession in Boston. Dr. Lillian
K. P. Farrar was in 1917 appointed visiting surgeon
on the staff of the Women’s Hospital in New York,
the first woman in New York City to receive such an
appointment. Dr. S. Josephine Baker, who established
in New York the first bureau of child hygiene
in the world, is probably more written of than is any
man in medicine. As chief of this department, she
has under her direction 720 employés and is charged
with the expenditure annually of over a million dollars
of public money. She is a graduate of Dr.
Blackwell’s medical college in which social hygiene
first began to be taught with the idea of making
medicine a preventive as well as a curative art. It
was the idea that Harvard University a few years later
incorporated in a course leading to the degree “Doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
of Public Health.” And though a woman had
thus practically invented “public health” and another
woman, Dr. Baker is the first real and original
doctor of public health, Dr. Baker herself was refused
at Harvard the opportunity to take their course
leading to such a title. The university did not admit
women. But a little later the trustees of Bellevue
Hospital Medical College, initiating the course
and looking about for the greatest living authority to
take this university chair, came hat in hand to Dr.
Baker, even though their institution does not admit
women to the class rooms. “Gentlemen,” she answered,
“I’ll accept the chair you offer me with one
stipulation, that I may take my own course of lectures
and obtain the degree Doctor of Public Health
elsewhere refused me because I am a woman.” Like
this the woman who has practically established the
modern science of public health, in 1916 came into
her title. It is probably the last difficulty and discrimination
that the American woman in medicine
will ever encounter.</p>

<p>The struggle of women for a foothold in the
medical profession is the same story in all lands. It
was the celebrated Sir William Jenner of England
who pronounced women physically, mentally and
morally unfit for the practice of medicine. Under
his distinguished leadership the graduates of the
Royal College of Physicians in London pledged themselves,
“As a duty we owe it to the college and to the
profession and to the public to offer the fullest resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
to the admission of women to the medical
profession.” Well, they have. The medical fraternity
in all lands took up the burden of that pledge.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">A WORLD-WIDE RECONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>But to-day see the builders at work at the College
of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Yale
and Harvard have also announced the admission of
women to their medical colleges. And it is not by
chance now that these three most exclusive medical
colleges in the United States have almost simultaneously
removed their restrictions. They are
doing it too at the University of Edinburgh and at
the University of Moscow. The reverberation from
the firing line on the front is shaking all institutions
to their foundations. As surely as if shattered by
a bomb, their barriers go down. Like that, the
boards of trustees in all countries are capitulating to
the Great Push of the new woman movement. All
over the world to-day the hammers and chisels are
ringing in reconstruction. It is the new place in the
sun that is being made for woman. The little doors
of Harvard and Yale and Columbia are creaking on
their ancient hinges because the gates of the future
are swinging wide. It is not a thin line that is
passing through. The cohorts of the woman’s cause
are sweeping on to occupy the field for which their
predecessors so desperately pioneered.</p>

<p>Forward march, the woman doctor! It is the
clear call flung back from the battle fields. Hear
them coming! See the shadowy figures that lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
the living women! With 8000 American women
doctors to-day marches the soul of Elizabeth Blackwell.
Leading 3000 Russian women doctors there
is the silent figure of Marie Souslova, the first medical
woman of that land, who in 1865 was denied her
professional appellation and limited to the title
“scientific midwife.” With the 1100 British women
there keeps step the spirit of Sophia Jex Blake pelted
with mud and denied a degree at Edinburgh
University, who in 1874 founded the London School
of Medicine for Women.</p>

<p>And there is one grand old woman who lived to
see the cause she led for a lifetime won at last.
The turn of the tide to victory, as surely as for the
Allies at Verdun or the Marne, came for the professional
woman’s cause when the British War Office
unfurled the English flag over Endell Street Hospital,
London. It floated out on the dawn of a
new day, the coming of which flashed with fullest
significance on the vision of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The beautiful eyes of her youth were not
yet so dimmed with her eighty years but that all of
their old star fire glowed again when the news of this
great war hospital, entirely staffed by women, was
brought to her at her home in Aldeburgh, Suffolk,
where she sat in her white cap, her active hands that
had wrought a remarkable career now folded quietly
in her lap.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson died at Aldeburgh, Suffolk,
England, Dec. 17, 1917.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Anderson was the second woman physician of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>modern times, the first in England. When as Elizabeth
Garrett she came to London to be a doctor in
1860, there was no University in her land that
would admit her. Physicians with whom she wished
to study, were some of them scornful and some of
them rude, and some were simply amazed. “Why
not become a nurse?” one more tolerant than the
rest suggested. The girl shook her head: “Because
I mean to make an income of a thousand pounds a
year instead of forty.” The kindly old doctor who
finally yielded to her importunities and admitted her
to his office, also let her in to the lectures at the
Middlesex Hospital with the specific arrangement
that she should “dress like a nurse” and promise
earnestly “not to look intelligent.” Her degree she
had to go to Paris for. Like that she got into the
medical profession in 1871 a year before her marriage
to the director of the Orient steamship line.
Dean of the London School of Medicine for Women
and founder of the New Hospital for Women, she
came through the difficult days when it was only in
“zenana” practice in India that English women doctors
had a free field. Russia too dedicated her pioneer
medical women to the heathen, modestly designing
them for the Mussulman population and at
length permitting them the designation “physician
to women and children.” That idea lingered long
with civilisation. As late as 1910 a distinguished
British surgeon in a public address allowed that there
was this province for the woman physician, the treatment
of women and children. But any medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
woman “who professed to treat all comers,” her he
held to be an “abomination.”</p>

<p>Then the world turned in its orbit and came to
1914. And Elizabeth Anderson’s eyes looked on
the glory of Endell Street. Do you happen to be of
that woman movement which but yesterday moved
upward toward the top in any of the professions so
laboriously and so heavily handicapped? Then for
you also, Endell Street is the shining citadel that to-day
marks the final capitulation of the medical profession
to the woman’s cause, as surely as the New
York Infirmary in Livingston Place still stands as
the early outpost established by the brave pioneers.
But the ordinary chance traveller who may search
out the unique war hospital in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Giles in High Holborn, I suppose may miss some of
this spiritual significance to which a woman thrills.
The buildings which have been converted from an
ancient almshouse to the uses of a hospital are as
dismal and as dingy as any can be in London. They
are surrounded by a fifteen foot high brick wall covered
with war placards, a red one “Air Raid Warning,”
a blue one “Join the Royal Marines,” and a
black one “Why More Men are Needed. This is
going to be a long drawn out struggle. We shall
not sheathe the sword until—” and the rest is torn
off where it flapped loose in the winter wind.</p>

<p>In a corner of this wall is set Christ Church, beside
which a porter opens a gate to admit you to
the courtyard. Here where the ambulances come
through in the dark, the bands play on visitors’ day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
It is a grey court yard with ornamental boxes of
bright green privet. On the benches about wait the
soldiers, legless soldiers, armless soldiers, some of
them blind soldiers. On convalescent parade in blue
cotton uniform with the gaiety of red neckties, every
man of them at two o’clock on a Tuesday is eager, expectant,
waiting—for his woman. Mothers, wives,
sweethearts are arriving, the girls with flowers, the
women with babies in their arms. And each grabs
his own to his hungry heart. You go by the terrible
pain and the terrible joy of it all that grips you so
at the throat. Inside where each woman just sits by
the bedside to hold her man’s hand, it is more numb
and more still. A girl orderly in khaki takes you
through. Her blue shoulder straps are brass lettered
“W. H. C.,” “Women’s Hospital Corps.”
The only man about the place who is not a patient
is the porter at the gate. The women in khaki with
the epaulets in red, also brass lettered “W. H. C.,”
are the physicians and surgeons.</p>

<p>There is one of these you should not miss. You
will know her by her mascot, the little fluffy white
dog “Baby” that follows close at her heels. Her
figure in its Norfolk belted jacket is slightly below
the medium height. Her short swinging skirt reveals
trim brown clad ankles and low brown shoes.
She has abundant red brown hair that is plainly
parted and rolled away on either side from a low
smooth brow to fasten in a heavy knot at the back
of her head. I set down all of these details as being
of some interest concerning a woman you surely will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
want to see. Surgeon in chief and the commanding
officer in charge of this military hospital with 600
beds, she is the daughter of Dr. Elizabeth Garrett
Anderson. She is also the niece of Mrs. Millicent
Garrett Fawcett, president of the National Union of
Women’s Suffrage Societies. And she is to-day one
of England’s greatest surgeons, Dr. Louisa Garrett
Anderson, with the rank of major in the English
army.</p>

<p>Her place in this new woman movement is the
more significant because of her prominent affiliation
with that of yesterday. For the militancy in which
she is now enlisted Dr. Anderson had her training
in that other militancy that landed women in Holloway
Jail. Her transfer to her present place of government
service has come about in a way that makes
her one of our most famous victory exhibits. “You
have silenced all your critics” the War Office told
her when they bestowed on her the honour of her
present official rank as she and her Woman’s Hospital
Corps “took” Endell Street.</p>

<p>It was a stronghold that did not capitulate by any
means at the first onslaught of the women’s forces.
There was, at least, as you might say, a preliminary
skirmish. The Woman’s Hospital Corps raised and
financed by British medical women was at the beginning
of the war offered to the British Government.
But in the public eye these were only “physicians to
women and children.” Kitchener swore a great oath
and said he’d have none of them for his soldiers.
Practically the War Office told them to “run along.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Well, they did. They went over the Channel.
“They are going now to advance the woman’s cause
by a hundred years. O, if only I were ten years
younger,” sighed Elizabeth Anderson wistfully as
she waved them farewell at Southampton on the
morning of Sept. 15, 1914.</p>

<p>France was in worse plight than England. Under
the Femmes de France of the Croix Rouge, the
Government there permitted the Women’s Hospital
Corps to establish themselves in what had been
Claridge’s Hotel in the Champs Elysées. In the
course of time rumours reached the British War
office of this soldiers’ hospital in Paris run by English
women. Oh, well, of course, women surgeons
might do for French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poilus</i>. At length it was
learned however that even the British Tommies were
falling into their hands. And Sir Alfred Keogh,
director of the General Medical Council, was hurried
across to see about it.</p>

<p>“Miss Anderson,” he addressed the surgeon in
charge, “I should like to look over the institution.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she acquiesced. “But it’s Dr. Anderson,
if you please.” Three times as they went
through the wards, he repeated his mistake. And
three times she suggested gravely, “Dr. Anderson,
if you please.”</p>

</div>

<p>They had finished the rounds. “This,” he said,
“is remarkable, ’er quite remarkable, don’t you know.
But may I talk with some of your patients privately?”</p>

<p>Then the soldiers themselves, British soldiers, assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
him of their complete satisfaction with the
surgical treatment they had received. Indeed the
word, they said, was out in all the trenches that the
Women’s Hospital was the place to get to when a
man was wounded. Women surgeons took more
pains, they were less hasty about cutting off arms
and legs, you see. Oh, the Women’s Hospital was
all right.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary, most extraordinary,” murmured
Sir Alfred Keogh. And this report he carried back
to the General Medical Council. “Incredible as it
may seem, gentlemen,” he announced gravely, “it
seems to be so.”</p>

<p>“It appears then,” brusquely decided Kitchener,
“that these women surgeons are too good to be
wasted on France.” And promptly their country
and the War Office invited them to London. It was
England’s crack regiment after the great drive on
the Somme that was tucked under the covers for
repairs at Endell Street. The issue was no longer in
doubt. “Major” Anderson and the Women’s Hospital
Corps held the fort for the professional woman’s
cause in England.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WINNING ON THE FRENCH FRONT</p>

<p>Dr. Nicole Gerard-Mangan, fascinating little
French feminist, meanwhile was executing a brilliant
coup in demonstration to her government. France,
it was true, had seen that British women could be
military doctors and surgeons. But the French
woman doctor, oh, every one was sure that the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
woman doctor’s place was the home. And if ever
there was a woman whom God made just to be “protected,”
you’d say positively it was Nicole Gerard-Mangin.</p>

<p>She stood before me as she came from her operating
room, curling tendrils of bright brown hair
escaping from the surgeon’s white cap set firmly on
her pretty head, a surgeon’s white apron tied closely
back over her hips accentuating all their loveliness
of line. She is soft and round and dainty and
charming. She has small shapely hands, as exquisitely
done as if modelled by a sculptor. I looked
at her hands in the most amazement, the hands that
have had men’s lives in their keeping, little hands
that by the sure swift skill of them have brought
thousands of men back from death’s door. You’d
easily think of her as belonging in a pink satin boudoir
or leading a cotillion with a King of France.
And she’s been at the war front instead. “Madame
la petite Major” she is lovingly known to the soldiers
of France. She too has that rank. You will
notice on one of the sleeves of her uniform the gold
stripe that denotes a wound and on her right pink
cheek you will see the scar of it. On her other coat
sleeve are the gold bars for three years of military
service.</p>

<p>This was the way it happened. In August, 1914,
Dr. Gerard-Mangin was in charge of the tuberculosis
sanitarium, Hôpital Beaugou, in Paris. When
the call came for volunteers for army doctors, she
signed and sent in an application, carefully omitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
however to write her first name. The War Office,
hurrying down the lists, just drafted Dr. Gerard-Mangin
as any other man. One night at twelve
o’clock her <em>concierge</em> stood before her door with a
government command ordering the doctor to report
at once at the Vosges front. The next morning with
a suit case in one hand and a surgeon’s kit in the
other, she was on her way. The astonished military
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">medecin-en-chef</i>, before whom she arrived, threw up
his hands: “A woman surgeon for the French
army! It could not be.”</p>

<p>She held out her government order: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N’est ce
pas?</i>” He examined it more closely. “But yet,”
he insisted, “it must be a mistake.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En ce moment</i>,” as they say in France, a thousand
wounded soldiers were practically laid at the
commander’s feet—and he had only five doctors at
hand. He turned with a whimsical smile to the toy
of a woman before him. After all there was an
alertness, an independent defiance of her femininity
that straightened at attention to duty now every
curving line of the little figure. His glance swept
the wounded men: “Take off your hat and stay a
while,” he said in desperation. “But,” he added,
“I shall have to report this to the War Office.
There must be an investigation.”</p>

<p>Three months later when the Inspector General
of the French army arrived to make it, he learned
that Dr. Gerard-Mangin had performed six hundred
operations without losing a single patient. “You’ll
do even though you are not a man,” he hazarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>A little later she was ordered to Verdun to organise
a hastily improvised epidemic hospital. For
the first week she had no doctors and no nurses.
There was no equipment but a barracks and the beds.
As fast as these could be set up, a patient was put
in. There were no utensils of any kind but the tin
cans which she picked up outside where they had
been cast away by the commissary department when
emptied of meat. There was no heat. There was
no water in which to bathe her patients except that
which she melted from the ice over an oil lamp.
For six weeks she worked without once having her
clothing off. One of her feet froze and she had to
limp about in one shoe. Eventually medical aid arrived
and she had a staff of twenty-five men under
her direction. There were eight hundred beds.
For seventeen months the hospital was under shell
fire. There were officers in the beds who went mad.
Three hundred and twenty-nine panes of glass
were shattered one day. A man next the little
doctor fell dead. A piece of shell struck her
but she had only time to staunch the flow of
blood with her handkerchief. Outside the American
ambulance men were coming on in their steady
lines. They delivered to Nicole Gerard-Mangin
18,000 wounded in four days, whom she in turn gave
first aid and passed on to interior hospitals. Later
when 150,000 French soldiers were coming back
from the army infected with tuberculosis, the Government
required its greatest expert for the diagnosis
of such cases. And Dr. Gerard-Mangin in the fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of 1916 was recalled from the front to be made
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">medecin-en-chef</i> of the new Hôpital Militaire
Edith Cavell in the Rue Desnouettes, Paris. It is a
group of low white buildings with red roofs. The
white walls inside are ornamented above the patients’
beds with garlands of red and blue and yellow
flowers. And the commanding officer’s own gay little
office has curtains of pink flowered calico. Grey
haired French scientists in the laboratories here are
taking their orders from Madame la petite Major.
Soldiers in the corridors are giving her the military
salute. One day there came a celebrated French
general: “When I heard about you at Verdun,”
he said, “I could not believe it. I insisted, she cannot
be a surgeon. She is only a nurse. I have made
the journey all the way to Paris,” he smiled in candour,
“to find out if you are real.”</p>

<p>The records of the War Office show how real.
Dr. Gerard-Mangin did her two years’ service at the
front without a day off for illness and never so much
as an hour’s absence from her post of duty. She is
the only surgeon with the French army who has such
a record. Her right to a place in the profession in
which no man has been able to equal, let alone surpass,
her achievement, would seem to be assured beyond
question. Let us write high on the waving
banners carried by the cohorts of the woman’s cause
the name of Nicole Gerard-Mangin. It was not a
simple or an easy thing that she has done. You
would know if you heard her voice tremulous yet
with the agony on which she has looked. “I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
nevair forget! I shall nevair forget!” she told me
brokenly, in the gay little pink calico office. And
the beautiful brown eyes of the little French major,
successful army surgeon, were suddenly suffused
with woman’s tears.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WHAT SCOTTISH WOMEN DOCTORS DID</p>

<p>Like this the woman war doctor began. Before
the first year of the great conflict was concluded,
there was not a battle front on which she had not
arrived. And the Scottish Women’s Hospitals have
appeared on five battle fronts. Organised by the
Scottish Federation of the National Union of Women’s
Suffrage Societies and supported by the entire
body of constitutional suffragists under Mrs. Fawcett
of London, they afford spectacular evidence of how
completely the forces of the woman movement of
yesterday have been marshalled into formation for
the winning of the new woman movement of to-day.
Dr. Elsie Inglis<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the intrepid leader of the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals, like a general disposing her
troops to the best strategic advantage, has literally
followed the armies of Europe, placing her now indispensable
auxiliary aid where the world’s distress
at the moment seems greatest. There have been at
one time as many as twelve of the Scottish hospitals
in simultaneous operation. Sometimes they are
forced to pick up their entire equipment and retreat
with the Allies before the onslaught of the Hun
hordes. Sometimes they have been captured by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>the enemy, only eventually to reach London and
start out once more for new fields to conquer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Died 1917.</p>

</div>

<p>These women in the grey uniforms with Tartan
trimmings and the sign of the thistle embroidered
on their hats and their epaulets, have crossed the
vision of the central armies with a frequency that
has seemed, to the common soldier at least, to partake
of the supernatural. Bulgarian prisoners
brought into the Scottish Women’s Hospital operating
at Mejidia on the Roumanian front looked up
into the doctors’ faces in amazement to inquire:
“Who are you? We thought we had done for you.
There you were in the south. Now here you are in
north. Are you double?” Of this work in the
north, in the Dobrudja from where they were
obliged to retreat into Russia, the Prefect of Constanza
said in admiration: “It is extraordinary how
these women endure hardship. They refuse help
and carry the wounded themselves. They work like
navvies.”</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the war, the Scottish
women left their first record of efficiency at Calais.
Their hospital there in the Rue Archimede, operated
by Dr. Alice Hutchinson, had the lowest percentage
of mortality for the epidemic of enteric
fever. In France the hospital at Troyes under Dr.
Louise McElroy was so good that it received an
official command to pick up and proceed to Salonika
to be regularly attached to the French army, this
being one of the very few instances on record where
a voluntary hospital has been so honoured. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Scottish Hospital under Dr. Francis Ivins, established
in the deserted old Cistercian abbey at Royaumont,
is one of the show hospitals of France. When
the doctors first took possession of the ancient abbey
they had no heat, no light but candles stuck in bottles,
no water but that supplied by a tap in the holy
fountain, and they themselves slept on the floor.
But eventually they had transformed the great
vaulted religious corridors into the comfortable
wards of Hôpital Auxiliarie 301. They might, the
French Government had said, have the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite
blessé</i>.” They would be entrusted with operations
on fingers and toes! And every week or so, some
French general ran down from Paris to see if they
were doing these right. But within two months the
War Office itself had asked to have the capacity
of the hospital increased from 100 to 400 beds.
And the medical department of the army had been
notified to send to Royaumont only the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande
blessés</i>.” At the end of the first week’s drive on
the Somme, all of the other hospitals were objecting
that they could receive no more patients: their overworked
staffs could not keep up with the operations
already awaiting them in the crowded wards.
“But,” said the French Government, “see the Dames
du Royaumont! Already they have evacuated their
wounded and report to us for more.”</p>

<p class="caption center">MISS NANCY NETTLEFOLD<br />
Leader in the campaign to admit women to the practise of law
in England.</p>
</div>

<p>It was in Serbia that four Scottish hospitals behind
the Serbian armies on the Danube and the Sava
achieved a successful campaign in spite of the most
insurmountable difficulties. Here under the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>primitive conditions of existence, every service from
bookkeeping to bacteriology, from digging ditches to
drawing water was done by women’s hands. It was
not only the wounded to whom they had to minister.
They came into Serbia through fields of white poppies
and fields of equally thick white crosses over
fresh graves. They faced a country that was overcome
with pestilence. All the fevers there are raged
through the hospitals where patients lay three in a
bed, and under the beds and in the corridors and
on the steps and on the grass outside. After months
of heartbreaking labour when the plague had finally
abated, the enemy again overran Serbia and the
Scottish Women’s Hospitals, hastily evacuating, retreated
to the West Moravian Valley. Some of the
doctors were taken prisoners and obliged to spend
months with the German and Austrian armies before
their release. Others joined in the desperate undertaking
of that remarkable winter trek of the entire
Serbian nation fleeing over the mountains of Montenegro.
Scores perished. But the Scottish women
doctors, ministering to the others, survived. Dr.
Curcin, chief of the Serbian medical command, has
said: “As regards powers of endurance, they were
equal to the Serbian soldiers. As regards morale,
nobody was equal to them. In Albania I learned
that the capacity of the ordinary Englishwoman for
work and suffering is greater than anything we ever
knew before about women.”</p>

<p>Like that the record of the woman war doctor runs.
Where, oh, where are all those earlier fabled disabilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
of the female sex for the practice of the
profession of medicine? A very celebrated English
medical man, returning recently from the front,
found a woman resident physician in charge of the
London hospital of whose staff he was a particularly
distinguished member. In hurt dignity, he promptly
tendered his resignation, only to be told by the
Board of Directors practically to forget it. And he
had to.</p>

<p>Why man, you see you can’t do that sort of thing
any more! Yesterday, it is true, a woman physician
was only a woman. To-day her title to her
place in her profession is as secure as yours is. Seven
great London hospitals that never before permitted
so much as a woman on their staff, now have women
resident physicians in charge. Five of them are
entirely staffed by women. The British Medical
Research Commission is employing over a score of
women for the highly scientific work of pathology.
When one of those Scottish Women’s Hospitals on
its way to Serbia was requisitioned for six weeks to
assist the British army at Malta where the wounded
were coming in from Gallipoli, the authorities there,
at length reluctantly obliged to let them go, decided
that the Malta military hospitals in the future could
not do without the woman doctor. They sent to
London for sixty of her. And the War Office reading
their report asked for eighty more for other
military hospitals. By January, 1915, professional
posts for women doctors were being offered at the
rate of four and five a day to the London School of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
Medicine for Women, and they hadn’t graduates
enough to meet the demand!</p>

<p>Like that the nations have capitulated. The
woman physician’s place in Europe to-day is any
place she may desire. Russia, which before the war,
would not permit a woman physician on the Petrograd
Board of Health because its duties were too
onerous and too high salaried for a woman, had by
1915 mobilised for war service even all of her
women medical students of the third and fourth
years. France has Dr. Marthe Francillon-Lobre,
eminent gynecologist, commanding the military hospital,
Ambulance Maurice de Rothschild in the Rue
de Monceau, Paris. In Lyons the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">medecin-en-chef</i>
of the military hospital is Dr. Thyss-Monod who
was nursing a new baby when she assumed her military
responsibilities. Everywhere the woman doctor
rejected of the War Office of yesterday is now
counted one of her country’s most valuable assets.
And so precious is she become to her own land, that
she may not be permitted to leave for any other.
“Over there” the governments of Europe have ceased
to issue passports to their women doctors.</p>

<p>You of the class of 1921, you go up and occupy.
Medical associations will no longer bar you as in
America until the seventies and in England until the
nineties. Salaried positions will not be denied you.
Clinical and hospital opportunities will not be closed
to you. You of to-day will no more be elbowed and
jostled aside. You will not even be crowded out
from anywhere. For there is room everywhere. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
the horror and the anguish of it, room everywhere.
And every day of the frightful world conflict they
are making more of it. Great Britain alone has sent
10,000 medical men to the front. America, they
say, is sending 35,000.</p>

<p>Hurry, hurry, urges this the first profession in
which the women’s battalions have actually arrived
as it hastily clears the way for you. The New York
Medical College and Hospital for Women, not to
be outdone by any institution now bidding for women’s
favour, has rushed up an “emergency” plant,
a new $200,000 building. The London School of
Medicine has erected a thirty thousand pound addition
and the public appeal for the funds was signed
by Premier Asquith himself. The nations to-day are
waiting for the women who shall come out from the
colleges equipped for medical service.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">A PLACE IN EVERY PROFESSION</p>

<p>And after the most arduous profession of all, how
about the others? If a woman can be a doctor at a
battle front, how long before she can be a doctor
of divinity? At the City Temple in London on a
Sunday in March, 1917, a slender black robed figure
preceded an aged clergyman up the pulpit steps.
With one hand resting on the cushioned Bible she
stood silhouetted against the black hanging at the
back of the pulpit, her face shining, illumined. By
the time that the white surpliced choir had ceased
chanting “We have done those things that we ought
not to have done,” the ushers were hanging in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
entrance corridor the great red lettered signs “Full.”</p>

<p>The house was packed to the last seat in the gallery
to hear Miss Maude Royden, one of England’s
leading suffragists, “preach.” This church is nearly
300 years old and only once before, when Mrs. Booth
of the Salvation Army was granted the privilege,
has a woman ever spoken from its pulpit. Some six
months since, Maude Royden has now been appointed
pulpit assistant at the City Temple, the first
woman in England to hold such a position. Dr.
Fort Newton, the pastor, in announcing the innovation,
declared: “We want the woman point of
view, the woman insight and the woman counsel.”
The City Temple is not an Episcopalian Church.
But even the established church has recently heard an
archbishop cautiously pronounce the opinion that
“we may invite our church women to a much larger
share in the Christian service than has been usual.”
You see there are 2000 English clergymen enrolled
as chaplains at the front. Laywomen were last
year permitted to make public addresses in the National
Mission of Repentance. They thus ascended
the chancel steps. A committee of bishops and
scholars—and one woman—has now been appointed
to see how much farther women may be permitted
to go on the way to the pulpit itself. A few of
the smaller churches in America have a woman minister
in charge. But from the arduous duties of the
highest ecclesiastical positions women in all lands
are still “protected.” High established places are
of course the last to yield. Theology continues to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
be the most closed profession. But Maude Royden
in the pulpit of the London City Temple, the highest
ecclesiastical place to which a woman anywhere
in the world has yet attained, has, we may say, captured
an important trench.</p>

<p>In the field of science the opposing forces are
even more steadily falling back before the advancing
woman movement. One of the most conservative
bodies, the Royal Astronomical Society of England,
has added a clause to its charter permitting
women to become fellows. The Royal Institute of
British Architects has also decided to accept women
as fellows and in 1917 the Architectural Association
for the first time opened its doors to women students.
Germany even has several women architects employed
in military service, among them Princess
Victoria of Bentheim. Russia, in 1916, admitted
women to architecture and engineering.</p>

<p>Chemistry is distinctly calling women in all lands.
Sheffield University, England, in 1916 announced
for the first time courses in the metallurgical department
for training girls as steel chemists to replace
young men who have been “combed out” of Sheffield’s
large industrial works. Firms in Leeds,
Bradford and South Wales are filling similar vacancies
with women. Bedford College of London University
had last year started a propaganda to induce
young women to study chemistry. In 1916 there
were some twelve graduates in the chemical department
and the college received applications from the
industrial world for no less than 100 women chemists.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
So insistent was the demand that even Woolwich
Arsenal was willing to take a graduate without waiting
for her to get her degree. Women are wanted
too in physics and bacteriology. A London University
woman has been appointed to a position at the
National Physical Laboratory at Teddington and
there were last year, at this one university, offers of
twenty positions for women physicists that could not
be filled. All over the world now, in trade journals
are beginning to appear advertisements for women
chemists and physicists.</p>

<p>Even in the teaching profession there is the record
of new ground won. Women have of course been
longest admitted to this the poorest paid profession,
and in it they have been relegated to the poorest paid
places. But now over in Europe, note that one-third
of all the masters in the German upper high
schools are enlisted in the army and with the consent
of the Department of Education women are for the
first time being appointed to these places, in some
instances even at the same salaries as were received
by the men whom they replace. Russia had in the
first year of the war opened the highest teaching positions
in that country to women, by a special act of
the Duma providing that “their salaries shall equal
those of men in the same position.” Russia also in
1915 had her first woman college professor, <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>.
Ostrovskaia, occupying the chair of Russian history
at the University of Petrograd. In 1916 <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle</abbr>.
Josephine Ioteyko, a celebrated Polish scientist, had
been invited to lecture at the College de France in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Paris. In 1917 Germany had its first woman professor
of music, Fraulein Marie Bender, at the Royal
High School of Music in Charlottenburg. And in
the same year England had appointed its first woman
to an open university chair, when Dr. Caroline Spurgeon
was made professor of English literature at
Bedford College.</p>

women lawyers marks an epoch in history. It is the first time
in the world that women have conducted cases before a military
tribunal.</p>
</div>

<p>In each country like this, where the opposing professional
lines begin to show a weakened resistance,
surely, sometimes silently, but irresistibly and inevitably,
the new woman movement is taking possession.
Next to medicine the legal profession, one
may say, is at present the scene of active operations.
The woman movement in law, as in medicine, began
for all the world in the United States. It was in
1872 that one Mrs. Myra Bradwell of Chicago
knocked at the tight shut doors of the legal profession
in the State of Illinois. Of course her request
was refused. Public opinion blushed that a woman
should be guilty of such effrontery, and the learned
judges of the court rebuked the ambitious lady with
their finding that: “The natural and proper timidity
which belongs to the female sex unfits it for many
of the occupations of civil life. And the harmony
of interests which belong to the family institution
is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct
and independent career from that of her husband.”
Syracuse University, which gave to the
world the first woman physician, also graduated
Belva A. Lockwood, who in 1879 was the first
woman to be permitted to practise law before the
Supreme Court of the United States. Every State
but Virginia has now admitted women to the practice
of law. There are something over 1000 women
lawyers in the United States. Their way in and
their way up has been attended with the same difficulties
that women encountered just about a generation
ahead of them in the medical profession. The
University of Michigan was one of the first institutions
to admit women to its law school on the same
terms as men. The Women’s Law class at New
York University was started in the nineties. Many
law colleges, as Boston, Buffalo and Cornell, have
since opened their doors. It was in 1915 that Harvard
University announced the Cambridge Law
School, the first graduate law school in America exclusively
for women, and the only graduate law
school open to them in the East.</p>

<p>But opportunities for professional advancement
for women in law have been exceedingly limited.
It is on the judge’s bench, in every land, that their
masculine colleagues have most stubbornly refused
to move up and make room. So it is noteworthy
that Georgiana P. Bullock was in 1916 made a
Judge of the Woman’s Court in Los Angeles, the
first tribunal of its kind in the world. A few women
have been allowed a place as judges in the children’s
courts. Catherine Waugh McCulloch of Chicago,
who some years ago as justice of the peace was the
first woman anywhere in the world to have arrived
at any judicial office, scored another victory in December,
1917, when she was made a master in chancery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the first woman to receive such an appointment.
Litta Belle Hibben, deputy district attorney in Los
Angeles in 1915, and Annette Abbot Adams, assistant
United States district attorney in San Francisco
in the same year, were the first women to arrive at
these appointments. Helen P. McCormick, in 1917
assistant district attorney in New York, is the first
woman in the more conservative East to become a
public prosecutor. There is a reason for this advance.
Could a woman really be accepted as an
expert in the interpretation of laws, so long as she
was permitted no share in making them? With the
pressure of the woman movement at the gates of
government resulting in enfranchisement, that
handicap of civic inferiority is being removed.</p>

<p>Like this even in the United States farthest from
the war zone, the rear guard of the women’s lines in
the legal profession are moving. At the front “over
there,” every country reports distinct progress.
Even a deputation of Austrian women have been to
their department of state to demand admission to
the legal profession. In October, 1917, on a petition
from the German Association of Women Lawyers,
the Prussian Ministry of Justice made the first
appointment of women in the Central Berlin law
courts, three women having legally qualified there
as law clerks. In Russia directly after the revolution
one of the first reforms secured by the Minister
of Justice was the admission of women lawyers to
the privilege of conducting cases in court on equal
terms with the men of the profession. The Italian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Parliament in 1917 passed a bill granting to women
in that country the right to practise law.</p>

<p>Specially significant is the legal situation in England,
the land where Chrystabel Pankhurst, denied
the opportunity to practise law, became instead a
smashing suffragette. Now, see the vacant places
in the London law courts where day by day women
clerks are appearing with all of the duties, though
not yet the recognition, as solicitors. And the English
Parliament at last is considering a bill which
shall permit women to be admitted to this branch
of the legal profession in England. This bill really
should be known as Nancy Nettlefold’s bill. The
year that Nancy Nettlefold arrived at her twenty-first
birthday and was presented at court, Cambridge
University announced in June, 1912, that she had
taken the law tripos, her place being between the
first and second man in the first class honours list.
And she at the time determined to make the winning
of the legal profession her contribution to the woman’s
cause. With four other English women, who
have also passed brilliant law examinations, she has
financed and worked indefatigably in the campaign
to that end. To-day they have that conservative
organ of public opinion, the London <cite>Times</cite>, urging
in favour of their case: “Many prejudices against
women have been shattered in this war. And there
is no stronger theoretical case against the woman
lawyer as such than against the woman doctor.”
The bill permitting women to enter the Law Society
has passed a second reading in the House of Lords,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Lord Buckmaster, its sponsor, declaring: “The
true sphere of a woman’s work ought to be measured
by the world’s need for her services and by her capacity
to perform that work.”</p>

<p>And the world’s need presses steadily, inexorably
day by day. France had called 1500 men lawyers
to the colours when the War Office sent a brief
notice to the bar association of Paris: “On account
of the absence of so many men at the front,” read
the summons, “women lawyers are wanted in the
Ministry of War.” Women have been in the legal
profession in France since 1900. There are 52
women lawyers in Paris. But their practice has
been limited largely to women clients. Madame
Miropolsky has made a reputation as a divorce lawyer.
Madame Maria Verone is the prominent barrister
of the Children’s Court. A year ago I heard
Avocat Suzanne Grinberg plead a case before a
tribunal which up to 1914 had never listened to a
woman’s voice.</p>

</div>

<p>As she stood there in the ancient Palais de Justice
of Paris, her small, well formed head wound round
with its black braid, her red lips framing with easy
facility the learned legal phrases, her expressive
hands accentuating her points with eager gesture,
her woman’s figure in the flowing legal robe of black
serge with the white muslin cravat, was outlined
against a thousand years of history. Eight soldiers
with bayonets stood on guard at the rear of the room.
The court whom she addressed was seven judges of
military rank in splendid military uniform. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
her client was a soldier. This is the Conseil de la
Guerre. See the epitage, the sash that falls from
Suzanne Grinberg’s left shoulder. It is edged with
ermine, the sign that she is entitled to plead before
the Tribunal of War. It is the first time in the history
of the world, here in France, that women lawyers
have been empowered to appear in military
cases. The Salle de Pas-Perdus, they call the great
central promenade at the Palais de Justice. Note
that these new women lawyers who wear the ermine
walk in the Hall of Lost Footsteps! On the walls
of this court house in which Suzanne Grinberg
pleads, you may read wreathed in the tricolours of
France, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avocats à la Cour d’Appel de Paris Morts
pour la Patrie</i>,” and there follow 127 names.</p>

<p>Only the day before yesterday woman’s capacity
for the higher education to fit her for the professions
was in grave doubt. Vassar College once stood as
the farthest outpost of radical feminism, and Christian
women were counselled by their clergymen not
to send their daughters there. Even after the moral
stigma of a college education had passed, the critics
said that anyhow the female mind was not made to
master science and Greek and mathematics. And it
was only about twenty years ago that Phi Beta
Kappa decided to risk the opening of its ranks to
college women—of course provided that any of them
should be able to attain the high scholarship that it
required. The female mind, you know!</p>

<p>Well, at the last Phi Beta Kappa council meeting,
the secretary reported to that distinguished body that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
in the elections of the past three years, women have
captured in Phi Beta Kappa an aggregate of 1979
places to 2202 for men. What shall the oldest college
fraternity do in the face of this feminine invasion?
A letter on my desk says that the committee
on fraternity policy has been commissioned to take
under advisement this grave situation and report to
the council meeting of 1919! So the present Phi
Beta Kappa record seems to dispose forever of the
old tradition of the mental inferiority of the always
challenged sex.</p>

<p>Ladies, right this way for titles, please, one profession
after another takes up the call to-day. New
York University at its opening last fall registered
110 women in its law school, the largest number
ever entered there. Already the American medical
women are called and coming. New York City has
recently appointed women doctors for nearly every
municipal institution. The first mobile hospital
unit of American women physicians with a hospital
of 100 beds, to be known as the Women’s Oversea
Hospital Unit, is now in France. It is backed
financially by the National Women’s Suffrage Association.
And it goes from that first original outpost
of the professional woman’s cause, Elizabeth Blackwell’s
New York Infirmary for Women and Children.
Meanwhile the entire Medical Women’s National
Association is being organised for war service
under the direction of Dr. Rosalie S. Morton, who
has been made a member of the General Medical
Board of the United States Government at Washington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
The American Women’s Hospitals are
being formed for civilian relief at home and for
service with Pershing’s army. From the Surgeon
General’s headquarters in Washington the announcement
is made: “There will be need for the war
service of every woman physician in the United
States.”</p>

<p>And through the vast Salle de Pas-Perdus of the
world, the professional women are passing. The
Lost Footsteps! O, the Lost Footsteps! Forward
the advancing columns. Hush, there are ways that
are not our ways! On with the new woman movement,
but with banners furled before the woe of a
world! For all the pæans of our victory are
drowned in the dirge of our grief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">At the Gates of Government</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man in khaki stood at the door. And he
held a woman close to his heart in mansion or cottage—in
a rose bowered cottage on the English
downs, or red roofed behind the yellow walls of
France and Italy, or blue trimmed beside a linden
tree in Germany, or ikon blessed in Russia. All
that he had in the world, his estates, his fields or his
vineyards, his flocks or his factory, his shop or his
job, his home and his children, he was leaving behind.
“I leave them to you, dear,” he said.</p>

<p>The bugles blew. And he kissed her again.
Then he went marching down the street in those fateful
days of August, 1914, when all the world began
going to war.</p>

<p>So in land after land she took up the trust and
the burden that the man who marched away had
left her, to “carry on” civilisation. It was the
woman movement that was to be under the flags of
all nations. Ours too now flies behind the battle
smoke. A little while since and our men commenced
to stand in khaki on our front porches, then
went down the front walk to join the long brown
lines passing along Main Street on their way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
France. At Washington they told us why it had
to be. “They were going,” the President himself
explained, “to fight for Democracy, for the right of
those who submit to authority, to have a voice in
their own government.” In the name of liberty, we
too pass under the rod. But we fall in line to catch
step with the women’s battalions of the world. We
shall see them moving triumphantly even on the
very strongholds against which the woman’s cause
of yesterday dashed itself most vainly.</p>

<p>The tasks of the world were one by one being
handed over to women by men who were taking up
arms instead. By solemn proclamation of church
and state, the patriotic duty of thus releasing every
possible citizen for military service was profoundly
impressed on the women of every nation. Only
there was still one function that no country was
asking them to assume. In England a thoughtful
woman filling in her registration paper stating the
national service that she could render, wrote down
her qualifications like this: “Possessed of a perfectly
good mentality and a University training,
prepared to relieve a member of Parliament who
wishes to go to the front.”</p>

<p>But the lady wasn’t called. Whole brigades of
women swung out across the threshold of the home
into industry. Regiment after regiment went by
into commerce. Companies passed into the professions.
Cohorts even crossed the danger zone for
duty right up to the firing line. But government
was still reserved for men. Could a woman vote?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
O, my lords, the legislative hall was not woman’s
place!</p>

<p>Then the armies of Europe got into action. Even
as their primitive forefathers had done, the men of
the modern world came together to put liberty to
the test of the sword. They fight for the freedoms
their leaders have formulated—and for another
they did not know and did not understand. A freedom
that was enunciated from Holloway jail and
turbulently contested in London streets is also being
fought to a finish in front line trenches even along
the Somme and the Aisne and the Yser.</p>

<p>Sergeant Jones of Company C of the 14th regiment
of the Cold Stream Guards was a combatant.
He was a British soldier bravely defending his flag
against the Huns. And he found himself up against
a great deal more that his enemies also equally face,
the most revolutionary force that the world has ever
known in this Great War that is overturning the
destinies and opinions of individuals and the decrees
of the social order as lightly and as easily as the
dynasties of kings.</p>

<p>Sergeant Jones was bowled completely over. A
German bullet hit him, and another and another.
For weeks thereafter he was wandering on the
borderlands of death. At length he was drifting
back to earth in a roseate blur of warmth and soft
comfort. Slowly his mind began to establish again
the realities of existence. The roseate blur straightened
away and away from beneath his chin: it was
the cherry red comforter that covered his bed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Endell Street Hospital, London. Rip Van Winkle
himself came back with no more wonderment. The
sergeant awoke, a soldier literally in the hands of
women.</p>

<p>He couldn’t so much as bathe his own face. A
woman in a white headdress, with a red cross in the
centre of her forehead, was doing it for him. When
he opened his eyes again, a girl orderly in a blue
tunic was saying, “You can smoke if you want to.”
And she began propping pillows softly about his
shoulders. There was a queer numb feeling along
his side. He couldn’t find his right hand. “Never
mind,” the girl said hastily. She placed the cigarette
between his lips and held the lighted match.
He smoked and began to remember that he had gone
over the top. He pulled gently again for his right
hand. He tried to draw up his left leg. At the
least movement, somewhere outside the numb, tight
bound area of him, there were answering stabs and
twinges of pain. He wanted to flick the ashes from
his cigarette. As he turned his head and his left
hand found the tray on the little bedside stand, he
glimpsed a long row of cherry red comforters that
undulated in irregular lines. From where he lay,
he could see still, white faces, bandaged heads, an
arm in a sling, a man in a convalescent uniform
clumsily trying out crutches. The man in the very
next bed to his own lay moaning with face upturned
to the light, hollow, empty, staring sockets where
the eyes had been. In the bed beyond was a man
with his face sewed up in an awful twisted seam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
that was the writhing caricature of the agony that
had slashed it. A sickening sensation of nausea
swept over the sergeant. God in heaven, he
thought, then how much was the matter with him?</p>

<p>A woman was coming down the room, pausing
now and then by the side of a cherry red comforter.
By the waving mass of her red brown hair, she was
a woman, but not such as the sergeant had seen
before. His mother wore a black dress and his
wife’s, he remembered, was a blue silk for Sundays
and at home, why he supposed it was calico beneath
their gingham aprons. But this woman was in
khaki as surely as ever he had been.</p>

<p>Now she reached his bed. She stood looking
down on him with an air of proprietorship, almost
of possession. “How are you, this morning, Sergeant
Jones?” she asked, with firm professional
fingers reaching authoritatively for the pulse in his
left wrist. Without waiting for a reply, she was
proceeding calmly to turn back the covers. “We
have a little work to do here, I think,” she said,
gently grasping—could the sergeant be sure—it
seemed to be his left leg. “The dressings, you
know,” she was saying easily.</p>

<p>“But, but, ’er—the doctor,” he gasped in protest.</p>

<p>“I am the doctor,” she answered.</p>

<p>Of the female of the species, Sergeant Jones of
course had heard. He had never before seen one.
“I’ll be—” he started to say. But he wasn’t.
Then he would have jerked away. But he couldn’t.
“I want a doctor, a real one,” he blurted out angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p>

<p>A shadow of a smile flickered for an instant in
the woman’s eyes. Often she had seen them like
this. “I am the surgeon in charge, the commanding
military officer here,” she replied evenly. “After
awhile, I’m sure you won’t mind.”</p>

<p>She went quietly on unwinding him. He heard
her scissors snip. She was going to take some
stitches. Once or twice she had to hurt horribly.
She did it with deft precision. With the same quick
motions, the sergeant had seen his wife at home roll
out a pudding crust or flap a pancake. It was the
convincing sureness of the woman who knows her
business. Could a woman be a doctor, after all?
The strips of linen had piled in a blood stained heap
on the floor. With an effort the sergeant steadied
his voice: “What is there left of me?” he asked.</p>

<p>The doctor smoothed his pillow first. “Sergeant,”
she said very gently, “you have one perfectly
good arm. I think there will be one leg. Last
week the other—” But the sergeant did not have
to hear the rest of the sentence. When he struggled
back from somewhere in a black abyss, the hand
that last week had held the surgeon’s knife was
softly smoothing back the damp locks of hair from
his cold forehead. She drew the cherry red comforter
up and patted it about his shoulders with the
infinite sympathy that speaks in a woman’s touch.
She leaned over him with a glance that signalled
courage and understanding. Then she left him to
fight the fight he had to fight in the grim grey light
of that London day for his own readjustment to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
cruelty of existence. Was he glad that a woman
was a doctor? She had saved his life.</p>

<p>There were weeks of convalescence. The hospital
librarian in khaki stopped beside his cherry
red comforter. He turned his face to the wall.
There was nothing she could do for him. But in
time he came to watch for her on her rounds as he
did for the doctor. Finally he asked for books and
magazines and the papers. And the news of the day
that she brought him, flared with just two topics,
War and Woman. The one was man’s universal
activity, the other was his Great Discovery. You
know how pleased a boy is with a Christmas toy he
finds will go with some new unexpected action?
Women were in all kinds of unprecedented action.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE NEW WOMAN’S SLOGAN</p>

<p>The girl orderly in the blue tunic dressed Sergeant
Jones one day for the convalescent soldiers’
outing. A girl chauffeur of the Woman’s Reserve
Ambulance Corps picked him up in her arms like a
child and set him on the seat beside her and took
her place at the wheel. Could a woman drive a car?
She shot hers in and out of the tangled maze of the
London traffic as easily as a girl he had seen send
a croquet ball through a wicket. Other cars
whizzed by with women at the wheel. Great motor
vans, with a woman on the high driver’s seat, swung
safely past. Fleets of motor busses came careening
along with girl conductors in short skirts balancing
jauntily in command on the rear platforms. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
bus marked “Woolwich Special” drew up at the
Haymarket curb to take on a load of women munition
workers going out for the night shift at the
great arsenal. High on a ladder against a building
here in Cockspur Street, two girl window cleaners
stand at work in tunic and trousers. Girl footmen
are opening the doors of carriages before the fashionable
shops of Oxford Street. Girl operators are
running the lifts. Girl messengers in government
uniform are going in and out of Whitehall.</p>

<p>A kingdom is in the hands of its women. Round
and round the world has turned since yesterday.</p>

<p>Here in Trafalgar Square a crowd of a thousand
people hang on the words that a woman is speaking.
Jones had never heard Mrs. Pankhurst; he had forbidden
his wife to when she came to their town.
Rampant, women’s rights females were against the
laws of God and England. This, the arch conspirator
of them all, he pictured in his mind’s eye as permanently
occupied in burning country residences and
bombing cathedrals and engaging in hand to hand
conflicts with the London police.</p>

<p>Now wouldn’t it take your breath away? Here
she was doing nothing at all of the kind. A very
well gowned lady stood directly between the British
lions, her slender figure outlined against the statue
of Nelson. Her clear, ringing tones carried over the
listening throng to Jones and his comrades in the
Women’s Reserve Ambulance car. One small hand
frequently came down into the palm of the other in
the emphatic gesture that in times past brought two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
continents to attention. It is the hand that hurled
the stone that cracked the windows of houses of government
around the world.</p>

<p>To-day, as England’s most active recruiting agent,
the greatest leader of the woman’s cause is calling
men to the colours to win the war. Had she once
a slogan, Votes for Women? ’Tis a phrase forgot.
In the public squares of London since the war, her
countrymen have heard from Mrs. Pankhurst only
“Work for Women.” Round and round, you see,
the world has turned.</p>

<p>A puzzled Sergeant Jones asked the next day for
a book about the woman movement. It was Olive
Schreiner’s “Woman and Labour” the librarian in
khaki brought him. “But I wanted to know about
the suffragettes, the suffragettes. Did you ever hear
of them?” he questioned. So Rip Van Winkle
might have asked, I suppose, why, say, for women
who once wore hoop skirts.</p>

<p>The woman beside the hospital bed smiled inscrutably
for an instant. “Sergeant,” she said with
a level glance, “I was one, a militant, Sergeant,”
she added evenly. “And the doctor was in Holloway
jail, and your nurse. And the girl who drove
your car yesterday was a hunger striker and—”
She stopped. The truce! By the pact that was
signed in Kingsway, the most radical suffragists in
the world, along with all the others, were war workers
now in their country’s cause and not their own.</p>

<p>The woman in khaki was still. Jones stared.
She was dropping no bombs. Only the armies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
smashing. Nothing about here was broken but men—and
women were mending them!</p>

<p>At length they had the sergeant patched up as
well as they could. He would never again work at
his skilled trade. But they pinned a medal for
valour on his coat lapel. And they sent him back to
his wife in the north of England. The woman who
met him at the door fell on her knees: “My dear,
my dear!” She gathered him from a wheel chair
into her arms with a sob. The man who had gone
out in khaki was home again.</p>

<p>“Mustered out of the service,” his papers read.
But his wife will never be!</p>

<p>Mustered out of service. So was the man with
the twisted face, who never again can smile. And
so was the man with the blinded eyes, whose little
daughter on sunny days leads him to the Green Park
where he sits on a bench and talks to the squirrels.
Just so I have seen him sitting in the Gardens of the
Tuileries. Just so he sits in the Tiergarten by the
side of the River Spree. He is going to be “re-educated”
to keep chickens. And Sergeant Jones shall
learn basket weaving for a living! Oh, and there
are thousands of others!</p>

<p>After each great drive on the front, they are passing
through the hospitals to the cottage rose bowered
and red roofed, to the blue trimmed cottage and the
ikon blessed cottage. And now they are waited for
in plain little white houses where a woman on the
front porch shades her eyes with her hand to look
down Main Street as far as she can see. And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
isn’t the woman who can fall on her knees and gather
her burden to a hungry heart whose shoulders will
bear the heaviest load. It is the woman whose arms
are empty never again to be filled!</p>

<p>These are the women whom not even the peace
treaty will discharge from their “national service.”
Every Great Push makes more of them. And the
rest must always watch fearfully, furtively looking
down Main Street as the years of strife wear on.
Who shall say whether she too may be conscripted
to “carry on” for life. For this is the way of war
with women.</p>

<p>Like this, the trust and the burden have rested
heavier and heavier on woman’s heart and hands.
Millions of men will never be able to lift it for her
again. No one knows when the others will. Men
must fight and women must work.</p>

<p>So many men are with the flag at the front. So
many men are under the crosses, the acres of crosses
with which battle fields are planted. So many men
are in wheel chairs and on crutches. Women are
carrying on in the home, in industry, in commerce
and in the professions. Then why not in the State?</p>

<p class="caption center">MRS. MILLICENT GARRETT FAWCETT OF LONDON<br />
For fifty years leader of the Constitutional Suffragists, whose
cause triumphed in 1918 when Parliament granted the franchise
to English women.</p>
</div>

<p>Little by little, in every land, a voice began to be
heard. It was the voice of the man with the flag,
and the man with the twisted face, and the man
with the blinded eyes, and the voice of Sergeant
Jones. It said what the sergeant said, when from
his wheel chair by the window where his wife had
placed it, he took his pen in hand and wrote back to
Endell Street hospital: “Women are wonderful. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
didn’t know before. Now I wouldn’t be afraid for
you even to have the vote.”</p>

<p>And curiously enough, what the man in the wheel
chair and the man in the Green Park and the Tuileries
and the man with the flag was saying, the
newspapers began to repeat as if it had been syndicated
round the world. The <cite>Matin</cite> had it in Paris,
the <cite>Times</cite> in London and the <cite>Tageblatt</cite> in Berlin.
You read it in all languages: “The women are
wonderful. We didn’t know before.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">GREATEST DRIVE FOR DEMOCRACY</p>

<p>Then couldn’t a woman who could cast a shell,
cast a vote? Parliaments trembled on the verge of
letting her try.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be at all the difficult undertaking it
used to look to those women of yesterday, whose
place was in the home pouring afternoon tea or embroidering
a flower in a piece of lace. Why, to-day
they would scarcely have to go out of their way at
all to the polls! They could just stop in as easily
as not, as they went down the street to their day’s
work in shop and office and factory. Sergeant
Jones’s wife is out of the home now anyway from
six o’clock in the morning until seven at night making
munitions. Some one must support her family,
you know. Well, all over the world a new call
began. Simultaneously in every civilised land,
through the crack in the window of the government
house where man gathered with his fellow man, you
could hear it. In some lands yet it is only a murmur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
of dissent. But in many lands now it is a rising
chorus of consent: “Women wanted in the counsels
of the nation!”</p>

<p>At the gates of government, the new woman
movement has arrived. And not through the broken
window is it entering in. Without benefit of even
a riot, suffrage walking very softly and sedately is
going through an open door. In England, a gentleman
holds it ajar, a gentleman suave and smiling
and bowing the ladies to pass!</p>

<p>Democracy, the right of those who submit to authority
to have a voice in their own government, is
breaking through apparently on all the fronts at
once. It is a most remarkable coincidence. In
August, 1917, Parliament in England removed the
“grille,” the brass lattice barring the ladies’ gallery
in the House of Commons and symbolising what had
been the English woman’s position. The <cite>Times</cite>,
commenting on the proceeding, characterised it as a
“domestic revolution.” In the same month in India
5000 Hindus were applauding Shimrati Pandita
Lejjawati who at Jullundur had come out on a public
platform to urge that her country abolish purdah!</p>

<p>But the great drive for Democracy that now
thrills around the world at the International Suffrage
Alliance headquarters, began unmistakably in
Britain. Mrs. Pankhurst in the old days never
staged a raid on the houses of Parliament more spectacularly.
Just see the gentleman bowing at the
open door! It is Mr. Asquith, the former leader
who for years held the Parliamentary line against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
all woman’s progress. And smiling right over his
shoulder stands Mr. Lloyd George, the present
premier. Oh, well! The girl in the green sweater
who horsewhipped one member of Parliament, at the
Brighton races, is driving a Red Cross ambulance in
Flanders. The quiet little woman in a grey coat,
who fired the country house of another in 1912, is
rolling lint bandages. Sergeant Jones’s wife has become
a bread winner. Soldiers are not afraid for
women to vote. And cabinet ministers take courage!</p>

<p>There is a town in the north of England with a
monument erected to a shipwrecked crew: “In
memory of 17 souls and 3 women,” says the marble
testimonial. That categorical classification to which
the English ivy clings is about to be changed. Six
million English women are about to be made people!<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Bill passed by House of Lords and received King’s
sanction, Feb. 6, 1918.</p>

</div>

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities, politicians the world
over hastened to declare woman’s suffrage a “controversial”
question that must be put aside during the
war. And every government engaged said to its
suffragists: “We’re in so much trouble, for heaven’s
sake don’t you make us any more.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t,” the women agreed, as the organisations
in land after land called off their political
campaigns. It was for his sake—the man in
khaki. And in every land, the trained women of
the suffrage societies assembled their countrywomen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>to stand ready with first aid for him. Day by day,
week after week, now year after year, they have been
feeding the nation’s defenders, clothing them, nursing
them, passing up ammunition to them. To-day
there isn’t an army that could hold the field but for
the women behind the men behind the guns.</p>

<p>In England Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, president
of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage
Societies, had been a member of the committee that
in 1866 sent up to Parliament the first petition for
the enfranchisement of women. She had been a girl
of twenty then. It was a cause, you see, to which
she had given a lifetime, that she now laid aside.
With the summons, “Let us show ourselves worthy
of citizenship,” she turned 500 women’s societies
from suffrage propaganda and Parliamentary petitioning
to hospital and relief work.</p>

<p>But it was when Mrs. Pankhurst, the dramatic
leader of the Woman’s Social and Political Union
who had first smashed suffrage into the front page
of the newspapers of all nations, lay down her arms
to give her country’s claims precedence above her
own, that the world realised that there was a new
formation in the lines of the woman movement.</p>

<p>Emmeline Pankhurst was on parole from Holloway
jail recuperating from a hunger strike, when
there came to her from her government the overtures
for a peace parley. When the authorities offered
her release for all of the suffragettes in prison and
amnesty for those under sentence, she ran up the
Union Jack where her suffrage flag had been. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
no uncertain terms she announced in Kingsway, “I
who have been against the government, am now for
it. Our country’s war shall be our war.”</p>

<p>For a minute after that proclamation, you could
have heard a pin drop in the great assembly hall of
the smashing suffragettes. Then in a burst of applause
she had them with her: they would follow
their leader. Some few at first drew back in consternation.
Had their late leader lost her mind?
The girl in the green sweater looked dazed: “I was
in the front ranks of her body guard when we
stormed Buckingham Palace,” she murmured. A
very few were angry: “She’s selling out the cause,”
they exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>But she wasn’t. The greatest little field marshal
the woman movement has ever known, was leading
it to final victory.</p>

<p>When Kitchener announced, “We shall not be
able to win this war until women are doing nearly
everything that men have done,” it was the woman
who had organised raids on Parliament who now
organised the woman labour of a nation. On the
day that she led 40,000 women down the Strand to
man the factories of England and turned Lincoln’s
Inn House, her headquarters in Kingsway, into a
munitions employment bureau, opponents of the
woman’s cause the world over began an orderly retirement
from their front line trenches. The next
morning the London <cite>Post</cite> announced: “We stand
on the threshold of a new age.”</p>

<p>We do. You see, you could not have practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the men of all nations in arms for Democracy without
their finding it. And some of them who buckled
on their armour to go far crusading for it, are coming
to the conviction that there is also Democracy to
be done at home. When the history of these days
at length is written, it will come to be recorded that
the right of women to have a voice in the government
to whose authority they submit, was practically
assured by the events of 1917.</p>

<p>In that year, the women who came to petition the
English Parliament for citizenship, got what they
had for fifty years been asking in vain. For the
women who with Mrs. Pankhurst and Mrs. Fawcett
and Mrs. Despard of the Women’s Freedom League
now stood at the gates of government were: women
shell makers and howitzer makers, pit brow lassies,
chain makers, textile workers, railway engine cleaners,
women motor lorry drivers in khaki, women letter
carriers, women window cleaners, women bus
conductors, women engineers, women clerks, women
in the civil service, women tailors, women bakers,
women bookbinders, women teachers, women army
nurses, women army doctors, women dentists, women
chemists, and women farm labourers. Among them
was the wife of the man with the twisted face and
the wife of the man with the blinded eyes and the
wife of Sergeant Jones.</p>

<p>The capitulation of the English Government was
assured in the recantations of its greatest men. Ex-premier
Herbert H. Asquith spoke first: “I myself,”
he declared, “as I believe many others, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
longer regard the woman suffrage question from the
standpoint we occupied before the war.... I have
said that women should work out their own salvation.
They have done it. The woman’s cause in
England now presents an unanswerable case.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George agreed: “The place of
woman,” he said, “is altered for good and all. It
would be an outrage not to give her the vote. The
further parliamentary action now involved may be
regarded as a formality.”</p>

<p>General French, former commander of the British
armies, the brother of Mrs. Despard and of Mrs.
Harley who died at the front, crossed the Channel
to announce his conversion to the woman’s cause
through “the heroism, the endurance and the organising
ability of the women on the battlefields of
France and Belgium.”</p>

<p>The press of the country burst into print with a
new confession of faith. The <cite>Observer</cite> declared:
“In the past we have opposed the claim on one
ground and one ground alone—namely, that woman
by the fact of her sex was debarred from bearing a
share in national defence. We were wrong.”
The <cite>Daily Mail</cite>: “The old argument against giving
women the franchise was that they were useless
in war. But we have found out that we could not
carry on the war without them.” The <cite>Evening
News</cite>: “In the home woman has long been a partner—not
always in name, perhaps, but generally in
practice. Now she is a partner in our national effort.
And if she demands a partner’s voice in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
concerns of the firm, who shall say her Nay?” The
<cite>Northern Daily Telegraph</cite>: “The duties of citizenship
are fulfilled by women to the uttermost. The
continuance of the sex disqualification would be a
cruel crime and a blind folly as well.” The <cite>Referee</cite>:
“Women have earned a right to be heard in
the nation’s councils. The part they have played in
winning the war is their victory.”</p>

<p>Like this, the cause that yesterday was rejected
and most bitterly assailed of men was now championed
by the nation. This was a kingdom saying
Votes for Women. Field Marshal Pankhurst
would never again have to. Her war-time strategy
had won. When Mr. Asquith rose in the House of
Commons himself to move the woman’s suffrage resolution,
it had ceased to be a “controversial” question.
The measure was passed by an overwhelming majority.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">RECORD YEAR FOR SUFFRAGE CAUSE</p>

<p>The domestic reform that was begun in England
has echoed round the world. See that which had
come to pass in 1917: Four other nations, France,
Italy, Hungary and the United States had suffrage
measures before their parliaments. Members of the
Reichstag were warning that Germany cannot avoid
it if she would keep up in efficiency with the rest of
the world. King Albert announced that it should
be one of his first acts for a restored Belgium to confer
citizenship on its women. Holland and Canada
have just accomplished it in limited measure. Russia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
and Mexico in the throes of revolution have actually
achieved it. Women have for the first time
taken their seats in the governing bodies of three
nations, Hermila Galindo in the Congress of Mexico,
Mrs. McKinney and Lieutenant Roberta Catherine
McAdams in Canada and Jeanette Rankin in the
United States. A woman, the Countess Sophia
Panin, has been a cabinet minister in Russia. And
for the first time since civilisation began, a woman,
Dr. Poliksena Schiskina Yavein, as a member of the
Council of 61 at Petrograd, has assisted in writing
a nation’s constitution.</p>

<p class="caption center">MME. CHARLES LE VERRIER<br />
One of the feminist leaders in Paris to whose appeal for votes
for women the French government is listening to-day.</p>
</div>

<p>On with Democracy! Nations are convinced that
those who serve their country should have a voice in
directing its destinies. Land after land preparing to
extend its franchise for soldiers, as England with her
Representation of the People Bill, is reflecting on a
real representation. For every country is finding
itself face to face with the question with which
Asquith first startled Britain, “Then what are you
going to do with the women?” Everywhere at the
gates of government are deputations like that in
England who are saying, “We also serve who stand
behind the armies. We too want to be people.”</p>

<p>And some one else wants them to be. From the
training camps to the trenches, the supporting column
of the man in khaki stretches. Every knitted
sweater, every package of cigarettes tied with yellow
ribbon has been helping votes for women. And now
over there he is getting anxious about his job or his
home or his children. What can he know at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
front about food control or the regulation of school
hours in Paris or London or New York? And when
there are decisions like that to be made, “I’d like to
leave it to Her,” the soldier is beginning to conclude.
Why, war-time is the time for women to be free!
The whole world is athrill with the new ideal.</p>

<p>See the lines of women arriving before the government
houses. Theresa Labriola voices the demand
of the National Federation in Italy:
“Women,” she says, “form the inner lines of defence
for the nations. We need the ballot to make our
lines strong.” Yes, yes, agrees her country. You
shall begin right away with the municipal franchise.
And Premier Boselli and the Italian Parliament are
proceeding to get it ready.</p>

<p>In France, <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Dewitt Schlumberger and <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>.
Charles LeVerrier for the Union Française pour le
Suffrage des Femmes, present the “unanswerable
case.” The senate on the Seine, looking out, sees
many women wearing long crêpe veils in the delegation
before its doors. “Let us give them,” says a
member of the Chamber of Deputies in a burst of
poetic chivalry, “the suffrage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la morte</i>: every soldier
dying on the battle field shall be permitted
to designate the woman relative he wishes to have
carry on his citizenship for him.” Very gently the
women of France declined the suffrage of the dead.
Presenting a carefully prepared brief that was the
review of their war work, they said, “We can vote
for ourselves, please.” And who else shall?
There are whole communes with most of the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
dead. There are villages with not so much as a man
to be made mayor, and a woman filling the office instead.
The French Chamber of Deputies has before
it a bill to confer the municipal franchise on
women. “It is an act of justice,” says ex-Premier
Viviani. The <cite>Droit du Peuple</cite> declares, “After the
war, many homes will be maintained by women who
will perform men’s tasks and fulfil men’s obligations.
They ought to have men’s rights.”</p>

<p>Canada, too, thought to reward her women with
a vicarious vote. The “next of kin” franchise was
devised, by which the Government has conferred on
the wife or widow, mother, sisters and daughters of
men in the service the right to vote. But the delegations
of women outside the government house at
Ottawa do not go away. They still wait. “We
also serve,” they repeat. And the country, in which
no less than five provinces last year gave to all of
their women full citizenship, has promised now to
prepare the full direct federal franchise.</p>

<p>In Mittel Europa, Rosika Schwimmer is marshalling
the feminist forces. Under her leadership, a
great deputation has marched to the Town Hall in
Budapest. The resolution there presented for universal
suffrage was carried by the Burgomaster to
the Emperor. In reply, the Hungarian Feminist
Union has received the assurance of the prime minister
that the Government will introduce a measure
extending the franchise to a limited class of women.
At Prague, Austria, the Town Council has appointed
a committee to draw up a new local government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
franchise which shall include women. The free
town of Hamburg, Germany, preparing to enlarge
its franchise in recognition of the self-sacrifice of soldiers,
hears the voice of Helene Lange and 27,000
women. They are reminding the Hamburg Senate
that women, too, who have borne the burdens of war,
will wish to devote themselves to reconstruction and
in order to fulfil the duties of citizens, they claim
citizens’ rights. The Prussian Diet has before it
the petition of Frau Minna Cauer and the <span lang="de">Frauenstimmrechtsbund</span>
urging that suffrage for women be
included in the projected franchise reform. The
Reichstag arranging a Representation of the People
Bill has at last referred the petition of the Reichverbund,
the German National Union for Woman
Suffrage, “for consideration” <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zur kenntnisnahme</i>,
which is the first indication of their change of attitude
before the women’s offensive. The Socialists in
the Reichstag are urging: “Women suffrage is
marching triumphantly through other lands. Can
Germany afford to fall behind the other nations, with
her women less fully equipped than the rest for the
struggle for existence?” Meanwhile, Germany, as
other countries, is depending more and more upon
her women. Two leading cities, Berlin and Frankfort-on-Main,
both have women appointed to their
municipal committees. Frau Hedwig Heyl, that
woman behind the food control policy for the
Empire, who has turned her great chemical factory
on the Salzufer to canning meat for the army, says:
“Woman suffrage in Germany is a fruit not yet ripe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
for the picking. I water the tree,” she adds significantly.</p>

<p>Holland has seen in The Hague 4,000 women assembled
in the Binnehof, the public square before
the House of Parliament. On their behalf, Dr.
Aletta Jacobs, president of the <span lang="de">Vereenigingvoor
Vronwenkeisrecht</span>, presented to Premier Cort Van
der Linden a petition with 164,696 signatures, asking
for citizenship for women. “Society,” Dr. Jacobs
told him, “can only gain when the forces and energy
of its women, now concentrated on the struggle for
the vote, can be used along with men’s in finding
a solution for the many social problems for which
the insight of both is necessary.” And the Dutch
Parliament, making over its Constitution to enlarge
the franchise for men, decided on the amazing plan
about women, “We will try them first, as members
of Parliament. And if we find they can make the
laws, afterward we shall let them vote for law
makers.” So the new Dutch constitution gives to
women the “passive” franchise, which is the right to
hold all administrative offices, including representation
in Parliament. There is also removed an old
prohibitory clause, so that the way is now clear for
the introduction of a measure for the “active” franchise
for women—if it is found the dinner doesn’t
burn while they are sitting in Parliament.</p>

<p>A South African Party Congress, for the first time
it has ever listened to women, has received a delegation
who urge: “Half the population of the country
is composed of women. Can you any longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
afford to do without our point of view in your
national deliberations?” The Grand Council of
Switzerland is considering a bill which is before it,
proposing to give women the franchise in communal
affairs. Mexico is struggling toward national freedom
with her women at the side of her men. It
was not even considered necessary to incorporate in
the new constitution the woman suffrage provision
suggested by Hermila Galindo at the national convention.
The new Mexican Federal constitution
states explicitly that “Voters are those Mexicans who
are 21 if unmarried and over 18 if married and possessed
of an honest means of livelihood.” And
under this constitution, in the March, 1917, elections,
Mexican women quietly voted as a matter of
course along with the other citizens.</p>

<p class="caption center">DR. POLIKSENA SCHISKINA YAVEIN<br />
Who led 45,000 women to the duma in Petrograd to make their
calling to citizenship sure.</p>
</div>

<p>In all of Russia’s turbulent revolutionary unrest,
none of the divers parties struggling for supremacy
there, denies the claim of half the race to the freedom
which it is hoped ultimately to establish. The
Provisional government’s first announcement was for
universal suffrage. But the Russian women weren’t
going to take any chance. They remembered a
French revolution that also proclaimed “universal”
suffrage and has not yet done anything of the kind.
The Russian League for the Defence of Women’s
Rights said, “Let’s be certain about this. We want
our calling to citizenship made sure.” So Dr. Schiskina
Yavein, the president of the League, led 45,000
women to the Imperial Duma in Petrograd. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>their spokesman she told the government: “At this
time of national crisis we should have no confusion
of terms. Without the participation of women, no
franchise can be universal. We have come for an
official declaration concerning the abolition of all
limitations with regard to women. We demand a
clear and definite answer to two questions: Are
women to have votes in Russia? And are women
to have a voice in the Constituent Assembly which
only in that case can represent the will of the people?
We are here to remain until we receive the answer.”</p>

<p>Well, the answer came. It was an unconditional
affirmative, received in turn from the men who came
out from the government house to reply to the waiting
women: M. V. Rodzianko, president of the Imperial
Duma; N. S. Tchkeidze, president of the
Council of Workingmen’s and Soldiers’ Deputies,
and Prince Lvoff, president of the Council of Ministers.
And when the preliminary parliament of the
Russian Republic was opened at Petrograd in October,
1917, the chair was offered to Madame Breshkovsky,
the celebrated “Little Grandmother” of the
Russian Revolutionaries, as the senior member of
the council.</p>

<p>In New York City on election night of November,
1917, the newsboys shrilled out a new cry, “The
wimmin win!” “The wimmin win!” It was like a
victory at Verdun or the Somme. The cables
throbbed with the news that New York State, where
the woman movement for all the world began ninety
years before, had made its over three million women
people. It is now only a question of time when all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
other American women will be. New York State
carries with it almost as many electoral votes as all
of the 17 previous States combined, which have conferred
on women the Presidential franchise. The
strongest fortress of the opposition is fallen. And
President Wilson has already recommended women
suffrage to the rest of the States as a war measure
for immediate consideration.</p>

<p>It was from the hand of Susan B. Anthony that
the torch of freedom was received by every leader of
the woman movement now carrying it. On her
grave at Rochester, N. Y., we have already laid the
victory wreath. For Democracy, the right of women
to have a voice in the government to whose authority
they submit, is about to be established in the earth!</p>

<p>“One thing that emerges from this war, I feel
absolutely convinced,” (it is Mr. Lloyd George,
Premier of England, who is speaking in a public address),
“is the conviction that women must be admitted
to a complete partnership in the government
of nations. And when they are so admitted, I am
more firmly rooted than ever in the confident hope
that they will help to insure the peace of nations
and to prevent the repetition of this terrible condition
of things which we are now deploring. If
women by their enfranchisement save the world one
war, they will have justified their vote before God
and man.”</p>

<p>There is a story that the anti-suffragists started.
But it’s our best suffrage propaganda now. A
farmer’s wife in Maine, who had cooked the meals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
and swept the house, and washed the children and
sent them to school, and hoed the garden and fed
the chickens, and worked all the afternoon in the
hayfield, and was now on her way to the barn to
finish her day’s work with the milking, was accosted
by an earnest agitator, who asked her if she didn’t
want the vote. But the farmer’s wife shook her
head: “No,” she answered, “if there’s any one little
thing the men can be trusted to do alone, for
heaven’s sake, let ’em!”</p>

<p>But is there? From the rose bowered cottage, the
cottage red roofed and the blue trimmed cottage and
the ikon blessed cottage, and the plain little white
house somewhere off Main Street, there is a rising to
the question.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, this war was made in the land
where woman’s place was in the kitchen!</p>

<p>And the mere housewifely mind asks, Could confusion
be anywhere worse confounded than in the

<p>Hark! You cannot fail to hear it! The cry of
the nations is now sharp and clear. It is the cry of
their distress: “Women wanted in the counsels of
state.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rising Value Of a Baby</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> unto whom a child is born to-day, unto you
is this written. I bring you glad tidings. Blessed
are you among the nations of the earth. Wise men
all over the world are hurrying to bring you gifts.
Only lift your eyes from the baby at your breast
and in your mirror I am sure you shall see the shining
aureole about your head. Exalted are you, O,
woman among all people. Know that you have become
a Most Important Person. Governments are
getting ready to give your job a priority it never had
before. For you, why you are the maker of men!</p>

<p>The particular commodity that you furnish has
been alarmingly diminished of late. It is clear what
has happened with the present world shortage of
sugar: we pay 11c and 16c a pound where once we
paid four. The world shortage in coal has increased
its cost in certain localities almost to that of a precious
metal, so that in Paris within the year it has sold
for $80 a ton. It is just as the political economists
have always told us, that the law of supply and demand
fixes prices. That which becomes scarce is
already made dear.</p>

<p>Thus is explained quite simply over the world to-day
the rising value of a baby. Civilisation is running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
short in the supply of men. We don’t know
exactly how short. There are the Red Cross returns
that say in the first six months alone of the war
there were 2,146,000 men killed in battle and 1,150,000
more seriously wounded. Figures, however, of
cold statistics, as always, may be challenged. There
is a living figure that may not be. See the woman in
black all over Europe and to-morrow we shall meet
her in Broadway. There are so many of her in every
belligerent land over there that her crêpe veil flutters
across her country’s flag like the smoke that dims the
landscape in a factory town. It is the mourning
emblem of her grief unmistakably symbolising the
dark catastrophe of civilisation that has signalled
Parliaments to assemble in important session.
Population is being killed off at such an appalling
rate at the front that the means for replacing it
behind the lines must be speeded up without delay.
To-day registrar generals in every land in white-faced
panic are scanning the figures of the birth rates
that continue to show steadily diminishing returns.
And in every house of government in the world,
above all the debates on aeroplanes and submarines
and shipping and shells, there is the rising alarm of
another demand. Fill the cradles! In the defence
of the state men bear arms. It is women who must
bear the armies.</p>

<p>Whole battalions of babies have been called for.
If we in America have had no requisitions as yet, it
is because we have not yet begun to count our casualty
costs. <span lang="fr">L’Alliance Nationale pour L’Accroissement</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
de la Population Française is calling on the
French mothers for at least four children apiece during
the next decade. Britain’s Birth Rate Commission
wants a million new babies from Scotland
alone. The <span lang="fr">Gesellschaft fur Bevolkerungs Politik</span>,
which is the society for increase of population organised
at a great meeting in the Prussian Diet House,
has entered its order with the German women for a
million more babies annually for the next ten years.
And that is the “birth politics” of men.</p>

<p>Then to the proposals of savants and scientists,
sociologists and statesmen, military men and clergymen
and kings, there has been entered a demurrer.
Governments may propose, Increase and multiply.
She-who-shall-dispose overlays their falling birth
rate figures with the rising death rate statistics.
And there is tragedy in her eyes: “What,” she asks,
“have you done with my children? The babies that
I have given you, you have wasted them so!”</p>

<p>Is it not true? Even now along with the war’s destruction
of life on the most colossal scale known to
history, children throughout the world are dying at
a rate that equals the military losses. In England a
hundred thousand babies under one year of age and
a hundred thousand more that do not succeed in
getting born are lost annually. In America our infant
mortality is 300,000 a year. In Germany it is
half a million babies who die annually. The economics
of the situation to a woman is not obscure.
Conservation of the children we already have, is the
advice of the real specialist in repopulation. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
other suggestion she contributes. She has made it
practically unanimously in all lands. In the Prussian
Diet House it was one speaking with authority
as the mother of eight who interpolated: “Meine
Herren, if you would induce women to bring more
children into the world you must make life easier
for mothers.” “Messieurs, Messieurs,” called the
Union Française pour le Suffrage des Femmes to the
Société pour la Vie with its curious proposal of
money grants in reward to fathers of large families,
“to get children, you must cultivate mothers!”
“Gentlemen,” declared the Duchess of Marlborough
at a great public meeting on race renewal held in the
Guild Hall, London, “care of the nation’s motherhood
is the war measure that will safeguard the
future of the state.”</p>

<p>These amendments in birth politics offered on behalf
of the Most Important Person have been practically
adopted the world over. Chancellors of the
Exchequer are everywhere busy writing off expenditures
from the taxes running into millions, in support
of nation-wide campaigns for the conservation of the
child. Maternity from now on in every land takes
the status of a protected industry. Britain is ready
to devote two and one-half million dollars a year to
schools for mothers. France has voted a “wards of the
nation” bill, to provide for the care of 700,000 war
orphans, at a cost to the state which it is estimated
will mean an outlay of two hundred million dollars.
Public provisions for motherhood and infancy are
proceeding apace with provisions for the armies. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
you are going to have a baby in Nottingham, England,
a public health visitor comes round to see that
you are perfectly comfortable and quite all right.
And the municipality that is thus anxiously watching
over your welfare solicitously inquires through a
printed blank on which the reply is to be recorded,
“Have you two nightgowns?” In Berlin large signs
at the subway and elevated stations direct you to
institutions where rates are moderate, or even the
Kaiser himself will be glad to pay the bill. Similar
facilities are offered by the government of France in
the “<span lang="fr">Guide des Services Gratuits Protegeant la
Maternite</span>,” with which the walls of Paris are placarded.
Even the war baby, whose cry for attention
not all the ecclesiastical councils and the military
tribunals commanding “Hush” has been able to
still, at last is too valuable to be lost. And every
Parliament has arranged to extend the nation’s protection
on practically equal terms to all children, not
excluding those we have called “illegitimate,” because
somebody before them has broken a law.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">FINANCING MATERNITY</p>

<p>You see, yesterday only a mother counted her
jewels. To-day states count them too. Even Jimmie
Smith in, we will say, England, who before
the war might have been regarded as among the
least of these little ones, has become the object of
his country’s concern. Jimmie came screaming into
this troublous world in a borough of London’s East
End, where there were already so many people that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
you didn’t seem to miss Jimmie’s father and some of
the others who had gone to the war. Jimmie belongs
to one of those 300,000 London families who
are obliged to live in one and two room tenements.
Five or six, perhaps it was five, little previous
brothers and sisters waited on the stair landing outside
the door until the midwife in attendance ushered
them in to welcome the new arrival. Now Jimmie
is the stuff from which soldiers are made, either soldiers
of war or soldiers of industry. And however
you look at the future, his country’s going to need
Jimmie. He is entered in the great new ledger
which has been opened by his government. The
Notification of Births Act, completed by Parliament
in 1915, definitely put the British baby on a business
basis. Every child must now, within thirty-six
hours of its advent, be listed by the local health
authorities. Jimmie was.</p>

<p>And he was thereby automatically linked up with
the great national child saving campaign. Since
then, so much as a fly in his milk is a matter of solicitude
to the borough council. If he sneezes, it’s heard
in Westminster. And it’s at least worried about
there. Though all the King’s councillors and all
the King’s men don’t yet quite know what they’re
to do with the many problems of infancy and complications
of pregnancy with which they are confronted,
now that these are matters for state attention.</p>

<p>A first and most natural conclusion that they
reached, as equally has been the case in other lands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
was that the illness of babies was due to the ignorance
of mothers. Well, some of it is. And that has
proven a very good place to begin. For every one
else, from a plumber to a professor, there has always
been training. Only a mother was supposed to find
out how by herself. Now she no longer has to.
The registration of Jimmie’s birth itself brought the
Health Visitor, detailed from the public health department
of the borough, for her first municipal call
on his mother. She found Mrs. Smith up and trying
to make gruel for herself. After serious expostulation,
the maternity patient was induced to return to
bed, where she belonged. Gruel, the white-faced
woman who sank back on the pillow insisted, was
easy. Why, probably she should not have minded
it at all. Only that day before yesterday she had
gotten up to do a bit of wash and had fainted at the
tub. She hadn’t seemed to be just right since.
Neither had the baby.</p>

<p>The visitor leaned across the bed and removed a
“pacifier” from the baby’s mouth. “But he has to
have it,” said the mother, “he cries so much. All
my children had it.” Looking round at them, the
visitor saw that it was true. Each exhibited some
form of the facial malformation that substantiated
the statement. And one was deaf from the adenoid
growth. And one was not quite bright.
This was, of course, no time for a medical lecture
beyond Mrs. Smith’s comprehension. But the effort
was made to impress her with the simple statement
of fact that a pacifier really was harmful for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
child. There were inquiries about the baby’s feeding.
No, of course, it was not being done scientifically.
Well, the mother was told, if he were fed
at regular intervals he would be in better condition
not to cry all the time. And of course she herself
must not get tired. It was Mrs. Smith’s first introduction
to the practice of mothercraft as an art. At
the school for mothers recently opened in the next
square, where the Health Visitor had her enrolled
within a month, her regular instruction began.</p>

<p>The schools for mothers are now being established
as rapidly as possible throughout the country. It is
not an absolutely new enterprise. The first one in
England, from which all the others are being copied,
had been started in London by an American woman
who had married an Englishman, Mrs. Alys Russell,
a graduate of Bryn Mawr. Women recognised at
once the value of the plan. It was only a question
of popularising and paying for it. This the war has
accomplished. Government will now defray 50 per
cent. of the cost of a school under the operation of
either voluntary agencies or borough authorities.
Already 800 schools have been opened. Some of
the most successful are at Birmingham, Sheffield and
Glasgow, under municipal direction. Parliament,
you see, by financing it has established the school for
mothers as a national institution.</p>

<p>The “infant consultation” is the feature about
which its activities centre. Jimmie was taken regularly
for the doctor’s inspection and advice and there
is on file there at the school a comprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
record in which is entered every fact of his family
history and environment and his own physical condition,
with the phenomena of its changes from week
to week. The weekly weighing indicated very accurately
his progress. And the week that his weary
mother’s milk failed, the scales reported it. The
modified milk was carefully prescribed but the next
week’s weighing indicated that Mrs. Smith wasn’t
getting the ingredients together right. The Health
Visitor was assigned to go home with her and show
her just how. Like that, Jimmie was constantly
supervised. When the doctor at the consultation,
tapping the little distended abdomen with skilled
fingers, announced, “This baby is troubled with
colic,” Mrs. Smith said he had been having it a good
deal lately. Well, a little questioning corrected the
difficulty. The trouble was pickles, and he never
had them after that. Also he never had the summer
complaint, which the former Smith babies always had
in September.</p>

<p>You see, there is no proper cupboard at Jimmie’s
house. There is only the recess beside the chimney,
and flies come straight from the manure heap at the
back of the house to the milk pitcher on the shelf.
Mrs. Smith didn’t know that flies mattered. She
knows now, and at the school she has learned that
you protect the baby from summer complaint by
covering the pitcher with a muslin cloth. She also
has learned how to make the most ingenious cradle
that ever was contrived. It’s constructed from a
banana box, but it perfectly well serves the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
for which it was designed. That Jimmie should
sleep alone, is one of the primary directions at the
school. Of course, it is clear that this is hygienically
advisable, and there is another reason: these crowded
London areas are so crowded that even the one bed
the family usually possesses is also overcrowded.
With some five other children occupying it with
their mother, there was danger that Jimmie would
some night be smothered. “Overlaying,” as it is
called, is the reason assigned in the death certificate
for the loss of a good many London babies.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">BETTER BABIES ARE PRODUCED</p>

<p>Jimmie in his banana cradle slept better than any
of the other babies had. He had a little more air.
Also he was cleaner than the others, because his
mother had learned that dirt and disease germs are
dangerous. But it is not easy, you should know, to
keep children clean where every pint of water you
wash them in must be carried up stairs from the tap
on the first floor and down stairs again to the drain.
A frequent bath all around in the one stewpan that
perforce must serve for the purpose is out of the
question. But there was a real wash basin now
among the new household furnishings that Mrs.
Smith was gradually acquiring. There are so many
things that one goes without when one’s husband is
an ordinary labourer at the limit line of 18s. a week.
But when he becomes a soldier and you get your
regular separation allowance from the government,
you begin to rise in the social scale. Mrs. Smith,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
like so many others of the English working class
women, now during the war was “getting on her
feet.” And some of the improvement in family life
was certainly registering in that chart card at the
school consultation that recorded Jimmie’s progress.</p>

<p>When his father, home from Flanders on furlough,
held him on his knee, it was a better baby than he
had ever held there before. For one thing it was a
heavier baby: children in this district used to average
thirteen pounds at one year of age. And now those
whose attendance at the consultations is regular
average sixteen and seventy-five hundredths pounds.
Also Jimmie was a healthier baby. He hadn’t
rickets, like the first baby, who had suffered from
malnutrition. What could you do when there was a
pint of milk a day for the family and the baby had
“what was left”? He hadn’t tuberculous joints,
like the second baby. He hadn’t died of summer
complaint, like the third and the fifth babies. And
he hadn’t had convulsions, like the seventh baby,
who had been born blind and who fortunately had
died too. Yes, when one counts them up, there have
been a good many, and if some hadn’t died, where
would Mrs. Smith have put them all? The six that
there are, seem quite to fill two rooms and the one
bed.</p>

<p>Still in the course of time there was going to be
another baby. Governments crying, “Fill the
cradles,” seem not to see those that are already spilling
over. But the development of birth politics has
at last arrived at an important epoch—important to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
all the women in the world—in the recognition of
the economic valuation of maternity. It has dashed
acquiescent compliance in a world old point of view
most tersely expressed in that religious dictum of
Luther: “If a woman die from bearing, let her.
She is only here to do it.” Mrs. Smith will not die
from bearing to-day if her government can help it—nor
any other mother in any other land. Instead,
all science and sociology are summoned to see her
through. The rising value of a baby demonstrates
clearly that you cannot afford to lose a maker of
men. The British Government and the German
Government and the French Government, speeding
up population, are now taking every precaution for
the protection of maternity. The mortality record
for women dying in child birth in England has been
about 6,000 a year. In Germany it has been 10,000.
There was also in addition to this death rate a damage
rate. The national health insurance plan inaugurated
by several countries before the war was
beginning to reveal it: the claims for pregnancy disabilities,
the actuaries reported, were threatening to
swamp the insurance societies. New significance
was added to these phenomena when there began to
be the real war necessity for conserving population.</p>

<p>The Registrar General, laying the case before Parliament
in England, found it suddenly strengthened
by a book presented by the Women’s Co-operative
Guild. The volume constitutes one of the most
amazing documents that ever found a place in any
state archives. It is entitled “Maternity,” and is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
symposium constituting the cry of woman in travail.
A compilation of 160 letters written by members of
this working women’s organisation recounting the
personal experiences of each in childbirth, it reflects
conditions under which motherhood is accomplished
among the 32,000 members of the Guild. “Maternity,”
with its simple, direct annals of agony is a
classic in literature, a human document recommended
for all nations to study. The gentlemen in the
House of Commons, who had turned its tragic pages,
looked into each other’s faces with a new understanding:
there was more than maternal ignorance
the matter with infant mortality! And a new population
measure was determined on.</p>

<p>“These letters” impressively announced the Right
Honourable Herbert Samuel, “give an intimate picture
of the difficulties, the miseries, the agonies that
afflict many millions of our people as a consequence
of normal functions of their lives. An unwise reticence
has hitherto prevented the public mind from
realising that maternity presents a whole series of
urgent social problems. It is necessary to take action
to solve the problems here revealed. The conclusion
is clear that it is the duty of the community
so far as it can to relieve motherhood of its burdens.”
So you will now find the maternity centre being
erected next door to the school for mothers. The
Government in 1916, announcing that it would assume
also 50 per cent. of this expense, sent a circular
letter to all local authorities throughout the kingdom,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>urgently recommending the new institution “in
spite of the war need for economy at the present time
in all other directions.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">STARTING THE BABY RIGHT</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith was automatically registered from the
school for mothers to the books of the maternity
centre when the Health Visitor learned that it was
time. The medical authorities report that 40 per
cent. of the total deaths of infants occur within a
month after birth and are due very largely to conditions
determined by the state of the mother’s health.
A specific trouble is maternal exhaustion. Mrs.
Smith, under weekly observation at the ante-natal
clinic, was discovered to be hungry. She didn’t
know it herself, because she had so long been that
way. It gets to be a sort of habit with the working
class woman, who must feed her husband first, because
he is the bread winner. He has the meat and
the children have the soup, and she is very likely to
have the bread and tea. The clinic doctor, looking
Mrs. Smith over, wrote out a prescription. It wasn’t
put up in a bottle. It was put on a plate. Mrs.
Smith was to attend the mothers’ dinner, served
every day at the centre. The mother, being the
medium of nourishment for the child, the good food
that she would get here would do more than any dosing
that might be done afterward to ensure the
right kind of constitution for the coming little British
citizen. In the “pre-natal class,” under the instruction
of a sewing teacher and with municipal
patterns furnished by the city of London, she made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
better baby clothes than she had ever had before.
The materials, bought at wholesale, are furnished at
cost price, the entire layette at 10s. to be paid for by
a deposit of 6d. a week.</p>

<p>As time went on, Mrs. Smith’s headaches became
more severe. Carrying water and coal upstairs
greatly aggravated the heart trouble she had had
since Jimmie’s birth. Suddenly dizzy one day, she
nearly fell from a chair on which she was standing
to wash the windows. The next morning her feet
were so swollen she could with difficulty get on her
shoes. Her neighbour on the lower landing remarked,
“Of course, you’ll have to be worse before
you’re better.” And she herself knew no other way.</p>

<p>But the ante-natal clinic did. The doctor wrote
kidney trouble on her attendance card. That, of
course, was the technical diagnosis. He might have
said it another way had he written “overwork” and
“overbearing.” It was a long time since Mrs. Smith
had been strong. She had nursed two of the children
with measles right up to the day that the
seventh had arrived. Three months later, with the
eighth expected, she was going out charring. Her
husband was out of work. The 30 shillings maternity
benefit that would be coming to her from the
national insurance department on the birth of her
baby, would have to be supplemented somehow in
order to meet all the additional expenses of the occasion.
Well, the eighth baby was a miscarriage instead.
Then there was the ninth, and then there
was Jimmie, in quick succession. And with the five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
others and trying to keep up with all that she was
learning at the school for mothers should be done for
children, why it was more than one pair of hands
was equal to. She had now reached the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>The clinic doctor was telling her gravely that she
must have medical attendance at once. The business
of a centre is to supply supervision, but for
medical treatment the patient is referred to her own
physician. Mrs. Smith didn’t have one. Half the
babies of the kingdom are brought into the world by
midwives. Mrs. Smith could not afford a doctor.
Well, Parliament could. The bill, presented by the
physician in whose care she was now placed, was paid
half by the national government and half by the
health department of this borough. It is an arrangement
which is considered a good investment by
the national treasury. Without this aid Mrs. Smith
would have died in convulsions and a new baby
might never have been born. Careful feeding and
careful doctoring obviated both disasters and carried
the case to a triumphant conclusion. The baby is
here. On his first birthday anniversary he tipped
the scales at 20 pounds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith counts it a confinement <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de luxe</i> that
brought him. For the first occasion in her maternal
history she did not have to get out of bed to do the
washing. For two weeks she just “laid up” while a
Home Help took the helm in her household. The
Home Help is an adaptable person in a clean blouse
and a clean apron, who comes in each morning, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
cooks and scrubs, and washes, and gets the children
off to school. Her wages of 13s. a week were paid
half by the centre and half by Mrs. Smith through
her weekly 6d. contribution to the Home Help
Society. But there was a greater event than even the
Home Help. A “bed to yourself to have a baby in,”
is the dream of luxury to which the working class
woman with her new war-time allowance looks forward.
Mrs. Smith, carefully saving out a shilling
here from the “coal and lights,” and another shilling
there, perhaps, from “clothes and boots,” painfully
accumulating the little fund, had achieved the bed
of her ambition. And neighbours from the length
of the square and around the next turning came in to
look at her as she lay in state, as it were, the new
improved baby by her side.</p>

<p>There are improved babies like Mrs. Smith’s arriving
every day in England. They are not all
among the working class. They are reported with
increasing frequency, as at Nottingham and Huddersfield,
among the artisan class. Even comparatively
well-to-do mothers in the best of homes have
not in the past been always accustomed to the skilled
medical supervision during pregnancy which is now
afforded without cost. It is Parliament’s plan to
have the new maternity service as available for the
entire population as is public education for school
children. The city of Bradford exhibits the ideal of
a complete municipal system now in successful operation:
an infants’ department occupying a new
three-story building, with a consultation to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
600 mothers come weekly; a maternity department
with the ante-natal clinic; a maternity hospital, announced
as “the first of its kind” in the world; a
staff of municipal midwives for service in the homes;
a cooking depot, from which meals in heat-proof vessels
distributed by motor vans are dispensed to 500
expectant mothers daily; and a staff of 20 women
health visitors to connect the homes of Bradford with
all of this municipal maternity service.</p>

<p>Still England’s comprehensive scheme of assistance
to mothers grows. Down the street, Mrs. Smith
noticed one day another new institution that has
been started. It is a municipal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i>, for which the
Government pays 75 per cent. of the cost of operation.
The sign in the window says that it is a
nursery for the care and maintenance of the children
of munition workers. Three meals are provided,
and the charge is 6d. a day. Just around the corner,
the Labour Exchange has out a sign, “8,000 women
wanted at once for shell-filling factories. Age 16 to
40. No previous experience necessary. Fill the
factories and help to win the war.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Smith is thinking. The school for
mothers has taught her to. Do you know that the
number of children who survive the first year in good
health is 71 per cent. in homes where the wage income
is over 20s. a week and it drops to 51 per cent.
in homes where the wage income is less than 20s. a
week? The sociologists have also some very interesting
figures that were compiled at Bradford. In
1911 the infant mortality rate there in houses that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
rented for six pounds and less was 163 in 1,000;
house rent six to eight pounds, infant mortality,
128; house rent eight to twelve pounds, infant mortality,
123; house rent over twelve pounds, infant
mortality, 88. And here in London infant mortality
is over 200 per 1,000 in one-room tenements,
as compared with 100 in tenements of four rooms
and upwards. Now, Mrs. Smith, I don’t suppose,
has ever seen those figures. But she doesn’t need to.
She understands why the small white hearse goes so
continuously up and down some streets. She knows
perfectly well that there will be more light and air
for her children in three or four rooms than in two.
Also that the rent will cost her 9s. 6d. a week, where
now she pays 4s. 6d. But in a factory there are
women earning 25 and 30s. a week, and even up to
two pounds a week. Mrs. Smith is thinking.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE MADONNA IN INDUSTRY</p>

<p>Meanwhile over in France Azalie de Rigeaux, at
half-past ten this morning, will step aside from the
lathe where she turns fuses, to retire for say half-an-hour
for another service. Azalie de Rigeaux is a
munitions worker in trousers in a Usine le Guerre in
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banlieu</i> of Paris. See her now as she takes her
baby in her arms and seats herself in a low chair by a
small crib. A wedding-ringed hand opens her working
blouse from the throat downward, the black lines
of the cloth fold away from her bosom, revealing in
lovely contrast the white, satiny texture of her skin.
And she, too, even as you, a mother anywhere in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
world, smiles happily into her baby’s eyes as she
holds him to her breast. It is a mother and child
picture the like of which you will not find in any
gallery of Europe. Azalie de Rigeaux, crooning
softly here to her child, is a new figure in life, so new
that she has not yet reached the canvas of even the
modern masters in art. See just above the curve of
her arm where rests the bay’s head, the armlet that
she wears on her left sleeve. Embroidered on it is
that sign of her national enlistment, a bursting
bomb. It is important because it is the clue to the
new picture. All over the world war has called the
woman to the factory. And what shall she do with
the baby? Well, the baby is so valuable that the
state is not going to let it cry.</p>

<p>It is France that makes the security for maternity
gilt-edged. By the gifts they are bringing here, one
would say that this is the country that to-day takes
precedence of all others in its appreciation of the rising
value of a baby. As every one has heard, there
has not in a long time, in generations indeed, been a
surplus of babies in France. As a matter of fact,
they have always been scarce. And they are so dear
that the passion for the child is the distinctive national
trait. This building in which Azalie de
Rigeaux nurses her child to-day was erected at a
cost of 75,000 francs. It stands in the factory yard,
adjacent to the shop in which women make shells.
In this sunny high-ceilinged room, with plenty of
sunlight and air, rows and rows of dimpled babies
sleep in the blue cribs with the dainty white cover-lids.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Four times a day the mothers from the shop
across the way, as Azalie de Rigeaux has now, come
to nurse them. Outside the long French windows
there is a large French “jardin,” where the older
children, in blue and pink check aprons, play. The
nursery dining-room has a low table with little low
chairs, where they come to their meals. Nourishing
broths and other foods are prepared in a shining,
perfectly equipped kitchen. There is a white bathroom
with porcelain basins and baths of varying
sizes; on the long shelf across the room are the separate
baskets that hold the individual brushes.
Each child, on arrival in the morning, is given a
bath and a complete change of clothes. Once a
week they are weighed. The doctor and the staff
of trained nurses are alert to detect the least deviation
from normal. Scientific supervision like this
costs the firm 1 franc 35 centimes per day per child.
To Azalie de Rigeaux and the other mothers in their
employ, it is free.</p>

<p>It is this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> at Ivry-sur-Seine which is the
model recommended by the ministry of munitions to
the factories of France. The last feature to make
this, a national institution, absolutely complete, has
been added. It was the Union Française pour le
Suffrage des Femmes that one day held a conference
with the ministry of munitions. “Gentlemen,” they
said, “a mother who must go home from a factory
to stand over a wash tub, gets so tired that the baby’s
source of nourishment is imperilled. And when a
baby languishes, a future soldier may be lost.”—A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
state department was at instant attention—“Gentlemen,”
it was pointed out, “there is one thing more
that you must do.” Well, they have done it. In
this model babies’ building at Ivry-sur-Seine there is
a steam laundry in which two women are kept constantly
employed, so that there shall be no night
laundry work for the child whom the mother takes
home. There are washed eight hundred diapers a
day. You see there is nothing that the Government
will not do for a child in France. Nothing is too
much trouble.</p>

<p>Even her employers will be equally as pleased as
the state if Azalie de Rigeaux shall decide to give
another citizen to France. They have told me so.
“Why, it is patriotism,” the factory owner explained
to me, as we stood there among the whirring belts
and the revolving wheels of a thousand machines in
this <span lang="fr">Usine de Guerre</span>. “Don’t you see,” he patiently
elucidated, “I’m sure if she will only have the baby
every one else should do what they can.”</p>

<p>This is what they do for Azalie de Rigeaux. She
comes directly under the protection of L’Office Central
d’Assistance Maternelle et Infantile, which, as
you will read on all the walls of Paris, is organised
“to secure to all pregnant women adequate and suitable
nourishment, proper housing accommodations,
relief from overwork and skilled medical advice, all
of the social, legal and medical protection to which
she is entitled in a civilised society.” A visitor will
arrive from the nearest Mairie to inform the prospective
mother of all the aids that are available for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
her. All of the municipally subsidised institutions
have had their accommodations increased since the
war. There are the Municipal Maternity Hospitals,
where care is free, or there is the Mutualité Maternelle,
the self-supporting maternity club through
which one may make arrangements for accouchement.
There are free meals for mothers at the Cantines
Maternelles, which are spread over Paris. Are there
other children in the family, so that their care is a
burden to the mother? She must not tire herself
with the housework. They will be taken to the
country at municipal expense and she shall go to a
Refuge to rest in preparation for the coming confinement.
There are free layettes to be had at every
Mairie. A limousine will even take the lady to a
hospital if necessary. The military automobiles of
the army are subject to requisition for this purpose
by L’Office Central d’Assistance Maternelle et Infantile
of Paris.</p>

<p>There is also definite financial assistance. The
Government will pay to Azalie de Rigeaux ten francs
and fifty centimes a week for four weeks before and
four weeks after the confinement, with an additional
three francs fifty centimes a week if she nurses the
child. To this her employer tells me he will add
his bonus for the baby, 105 francs if she has been in
his employ for one year, 135 francs after three years,
and after six years it will be 165 francs. All indications
point to market quotations on the French
baby rising even higher. Prof. Pinard, the celebrated
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accoucher</i> of Paris, who has assisted into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
world so many babies that he should know their value
as much as any man may, is saying they are really
worth more. Through the Academy of Medicine in
France he is recommending to the Senate a measure
providing for a payment to a mother, from the time
that gestation begins until the child is one year old,
of five francs a day.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">IT MEANS THE LIBERATION OF THE MOTHER</p>

<p>But most significant to the woman movement of
all lands is the welcome that the Usine de Guerre is
extending to Azalie de Rigeaux. Of all the making
over they have been doing for us in industry, this is
perhaps the most revolutionary in its effects on the
whole social structure. For when industry takes the
baby, it means the passing of the wage envelope to a
whole class of the population whose arms were
hitherto literally too burdened to reach for it. Here
at Ivry-sur-Seine they do not shake their heads and
say, “Oh, you might have a baby. We prefer to employ
a man who won’t.” On the contrary preference
in employment is given to a woman who has a child.
The only person who takes precedence of her is the
woman with two children or, of course, with three.
From the day that she signifies she is going to have
another, she becomes an object of special solicitude.
She will be shielded from any injurious strain. Because
it may not be well for her to stand at the lathe,
she will be transferred to the gauging department,
where she may remain continuously seated. And,
while the gauging department’s regular rate of pay is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
but 50 centimes an hour, her own job’s rate of pay,
60, 70, 80 centimes an hour, whatever it may be,
will be continued.</p>

<p>“But isn’t it an interruption to your business to
have employés who every now and then have to stop
to have a baby?” I asked the French manufacturer.
“Ah, no, Madame,” he replied, “surely it is no disturbance
at all. It is nothing even if a woman
should wish to be absent for two or three months.
Is she not serving her country? We simply arrange
a large enough staff of employés so that always there
are some to fill the gaps. Maternity is something
that may be estimated by percentage. We count on
it that Camille here will probably have a baby in
July. Etienne, next to her, may have one in September.
Well, by the time a substitute employé is finished
with taking Camille’s place, she will be required
in Etienne’s place, then, perhaps, in Azalie’s
place. It is very easy, I say, to arrange.”</p>

<p>And it is because the rising value of a baby makes
it worth while. It is in France, where maternity has
always been important, that all of the institutions
for the welfare of the child now being rushed to
completion in other lands have been originally invented.
We in America, in some of our large cities,
have started the “clinic” and the “consultation” and
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i>. Italy is inaugurating them. Russia
sent to Paris for specific information about them before
the war. Germany’s “Kaiserin Auguste Victoria
Haus” in Berlin, a veritable “laboratory of the
child,” from which the child culture system adapted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
from France has been developed for the Empire, is a
monument to the national thoroughness, which, making
military preparation for the conquest of the
world, made maternity preparation on almost as
comprehensive a scale.</p>

<p>Industry to-day beckoning the woman, you see,
Parliament is bound to provide for the child. Mrs.
Smith in England—or in America or anywhere else—you
need not hesitate.</p>

<p>Azalie de Rigeaux’s baby is, what is it one shall
say, as good as gold all day long. Do you know
that he is so well regulated that there is no deviation
from his perfection save on Mondays when he gets
back to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> fretful and perhaps a little inclined
to be colicky after a week end at home? At
that munitions <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> down your street the babies
shall have a bath every day and no one will have to
carry the water toilsomely upstairs by the pint.
Think of the dainty cribs to sleep in and the beautiful
green garden to play in! There are three meals
a day that never fail. You can easier pay for those
meals than cook them. How many skilled vocations
are you trying to follow in your home! The
graduate of a school for mothers, you are doing, the
best you can, more than the winner of a Cambridge
tripos would attempt to undertake! Cooking and
sewing and nursing, laundry work and scrubbing and
child culture, that is the gamut of the achievements
you are trying to accomplish. Oh, Mrs. Smith, one
trade in the factory is easier. What artisan can be
good at his job if he must also putter with half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
dozen others? Well, the world is no longer going
to ask it of you, the maker of men!</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE CHILD’S CHANCE DEPENDS ON FAMILY INCOME</p>

<p>Tradition may still rise to protest: But the home!
You wouldn’t abolish the home! I think you would
if you had seen it, Mrs. Smith’s home. Child mortality
in her street is at the rate of 200 per 1,000.
I know a home in the other end of London that is
as lovely as a poet’s dream. Child mortality in
this district is 40 per 1,000. There is a great house
facing a park. There are three children in it. They
have a day nursery and a night nursery and a school
room all to themselves. They are cared for by a
head nurse, and an assistant nurse, a governess, and
a mother who now and then comes to caress them
and see that they are happy. There are, you see,
four women—to say nothing of the household staff
of eight servants indirectly contributing to the same
service—to care for three children in the West End.</p>

<p>In the East End Mrs. Smith has only one pair
of hands to do for seven, and she is no super-woman.
They live in two rooms that the fiercest all the time
scrubbing could not keep clean. The discoloured
walls are damp with mildew. You can see the
vermin in the cracks. There isn’t any pantry.
There isn’t any sink. There isn’t so much as a cook
stove, only an open grate. <em>There isn’t any poetry
in a home on less than a pound a week!</em></p>

<p>Down the street is the way out to the new home
that Mrs. Smith’s wage envelope will help to build.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
There will be at least 4 rooms and the children away
during the day under expert care. The little children
of the rich in the West End nursery have no
more scientific supervision than the municipal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i>
will afford Mrs. Smith for hers. I know she will
not longer personally wash their faces and wipe
their noses. Even when she tries to, as you may
have noticed in any land, she cannot possibly do
those tasks as often as they should be done. The
mere physical needs of children, any one else can
attend to. But only a mother can love them.
Hadn’t we better conserve her more for that special
function? The rising value of a baby begins to
demand it.</p>

<p>And don’t worry about the effect of factory employment
on her health. Two government commissions
of experts, one in France and one in England,
tell us it’s all right after all. Both report that a
properly arranged factory is as good a place as any
for a woman. Some significant figures presented to
England’s Birth Rate Commission show that the
proportion of miscarriages is among factory workers
9.2 per cent. as compared with 16 per cent. among
women doing housework in the home. Hard work
and heavy work, you see, are just as harmful in
Mrs. Smith’s kitchen as they might be anywhere
else—and not nearly so well paid! Really, in spite
of its historic setting there is no sacred significance
attaching to the figure of a woman bending over a
washtub or on her knees scrubbing a floor. Let us
venerate instead Azalie de Rigeaux nursing her child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
in a <span lang="fr">Usine de Guerre</span>! After the schools for mothers
and the maternity clinics have done what they
may to reduce infant mortality, the mothers in industry
may do some more. Take your babies in
your arms, Mrs. Smith, and flee from that stalking
spectre of poverty that has already snatched four
of them to the grave. The door of the municipal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crèche</i> stands ajar!</p>

<p>Like this, the world is making ready for reconstruction.
Let there be every first aid for the maker
of men. We await one more measure: Mrs. Smith
must never again have ten babies when she lives
in two rooms—nor Frau Schmidt in Berlin. This
unlimited increase that crowds children from the
cradle to the coffin, in the haste to make room for
more, has been the fatal force that has impelled
nations teeming with too many people to make war
for territorial expansion. We shall not blot out
from civilisation the Prussian military ideal until we
have likewise effaced the Prussian maternity ideal
of reckless reproduction. That the cradles of the
world may never again spill over, the nations must
rise from the peace table with a new population
policy. In the “birth politics” of the future there
must be birth control. When children are scarce,
are they dear. See France! The rising value of a
baby may yet lift the curse of Eve!</p>

<p>Then shall we be ready to repopulate right.
After the battles are won and man’s work of conquest
is done, woman’s war work will only have
begun. I have stood in the cathedral at Rheims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
and in the stricken silence looked with sickening dismay
on the destruction of the beautiful temple of
worship builded with such exquisite art and such
infinite labour. But I assure you not all the cathedrals
of Europe piled in a single colossal ruin,
broken sculptured saint on saint, can stir the beholder
with the poignant pain of one war hospital!
There in the whitewashed wards with the smell of
blood and ether, where the maimed lie stiff and
still and the dying moan and the mad rave in wild
delirium, stand there and your soul shall shrivel in
horror at the destruction of men! It is the agony
of it all, and the suffering and the sorrow and the
grief of it all—and then something more. You
creep with the feeling that every one of these men
once was builded with such exquisite art and such
infinite labour and such toilsome pain and anguish
by God and a woman! It is a stupendous task of
creation to be done over again when the armies shall
have finished their work. Bone of her bone and
flesh of her flesh, God and woman must rebuild the
race. You unto whom a child can be born to-day,
to you Parliaments make their prayer!</p>

<p>Not a captain of industry who assembles the engines
of war, not a general who directs the armies,
may do for his country what you can do who stand
beside its cradles. The cry that rings out over
Empires bleeding in the throes of death is the oldest
cry in the world. Women wanted for maternity!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ring and the Woman</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> woman who crossed the threshold of the
Doll’s House awhile ago—you would scarcely recognise
her as you meet her to-day anywhere abroad in
the world. She has put aside yesterday as it were
an old cloak that has just slipped from her shoulders.
And she stands revealed as the one of whom
some of us have for a long time written and some
of us have read. For a generation at least she has
been looked for. Now she is here.</p>

<p>You see when her country called her, it was destiny
that spoke. Though no nation knew. Governments
have only thought they were making
women munition workers and women conductors and
women bank tellers and women doctors and women
lawyers and women citizens and all the rest. I
doubt if there is a statesman anywhere who has
leaned to unlock a door of opportunity to let the
woman movement by, who has realised that he was
but the instrument in the hands of a higher power
that is reshaping the world for mighty ends, rough
hewn though they be to-day from the awful chaos
of war.</p>

<p>But there is one who will know. When the man
at the front gets back and stands again before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
cottage rose bowered on the English downs, red
roofed in France and Italy, blue trimmed in Germany
or ikon blessed in Russia or white porched off
Main Street in America, he will clasp her to his
heart once more. Then he will hold her off, so, at
arm’s length and look long into her eyes and deep
into her soul. And lo, he shall see there the New
Woman. This is not the woman whom he left behind
when he marched away to the Great World
War. Something profound has happened to her
since. It is woman’s coming of age. Look, she is
turning the ring on her finger to-day.</p>

<p>When the man in khaki went away, that ring was
sign and symbol of the status assigned to her by all
the oldest law books and religious books of the world.
And none of the modern ones had been able wholly
to eradicate from their pages the point of view that
was the most prevailing opinion of civilisation. The
most ancient classification of all listed in one category
“a man’s house and his wife, his man servant
and his maidservant, his ox and his ass and any other
possessions that are his.” An English state church
has given her in marriage to him “to obey him and
serve him.” A German state church has bound her
“to be subject to him as to her lord and master.”
Christian lands have agreed that a woman when
she marries enters into a state of coverture by which
they tell us “the husband hath power and dominion
over his wife.” Religious teachers from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul
to Martin Luther, law givers from Moses to Napoleon
have been unanimous on this point, which Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
framing his code for France summed up
briefly, Woman belongs to man.</p>

<p>This has been the basic assumption of church and
state from whose courts of authority each concession
of individuality for woman has been won only by
process of slow amendment. It is still so subtly
interwoven in dogma and statute that there is not
yet any land where a woman, though thinking herself
free, may not trip against a legal disability that
has not yet been dislodged. For Blackstone, the
great authority of reference, declares “the very being
or legal existence of the woman is suspended during
the marriage or at least is incorporated in that of
the husband.” And all over the world, all the
church councils and all the state courts have not yet
been so reformed but that by reversion to type they
will hark back to the pronouncement. Man and wife
are one—and he is the one. So the man’s mind
thinketh.</p>

<p>And the woman’s mind? Since he went away in
khaki, it has thought long, long thoughts. When
he comes back, this new woman looking into his
eyes with the level glance, he will find is a woman
who has earned money—in a new world that has
been made over for her so that she can. You see
all those lines of women in industry and commerce
and the professions? Some of them walk up to a
paymaster’s window on Saturday night and some
of them wait for the checks that arrive in their mail.
But it is an experience in common through which
all are passing. The open door to the shop and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
factory and the counting room, to law or to medicine
is the great gateway to the future where dreams
shall come true. For the women who have passed
through, have arrived at last at the great goal, economic
independence.</p>

<p>Now what that means the sociologists could tell.
Though they might not think to put it in terms
of, for instance, Elsa von Stuttgart’s slippers. They
would, I suppose, agree that economic independence
is the right to earn one’s living—and be paid for it
like a man. One earned it yesterday if one washed
the dishes and cooked the meals and reared the children
and kept the house for the other person who
held the purse. Housekeepers of this class have
been the busiest people we have had about us. And
yet the census offices administered by men had so
little idea of these women’s economic value, that
they have been actually listed in government statistical
returns as “unoccupied.” So also of course
were the other housekeepers who, eliminating some
of these most arduous tasks from the long day,
nevertheless were not at least idle when they bore
a man’s children and presided at his dinner table
and entertained his friends and practised generally
the graceful art of making a home. When they
undertook these duties, there was a church promise,
With all my worldly goods, I thee endow. That
figure of speech, the law courts reduce to “maintenance,”
that is to say, board and clothes. But, so
widely disseminated has been the idea that the lady
is “unoccupied” that these are generally regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
not in the nature of a recognition of service and a
return for value received, but rather as perquisites
bountifully bestowed on the recipient. So that frequently
her range of choice in the matter has been,
we may say, limited.</p>

<p>Frau Elsa von Stuttgart before the war had her
board and clothes. But her husband had forbidden
her to get her hats at a certain little French shop in
Unter den Linden that she had always patronised
before her marriage. And with all his money, he
decided that one pair of evening slippers would do
even for a woman in the social position of a Prussian
officer’s wife. They lived in a villa at Zehlendorff
that was perfectly equipped with everything
that he considered desirable. There was a grand
piano of marvellous tone, though she didn’t even
play the piano at all. She was a doctor of philosophy,
who before her marriage had been a teacher
at the High School in Berlin and her hobby, it happened,
was books. She liked them in beautiful
bindings and she always used to buy them that way.
But of course she couldn’t any more because her
husband said it was extravagance, quite useless extravagance.
Well, really you know, maintenance
may be slippers and hats, but it isn’t books after
all. And she had a lovely house and a piano of
marvellous tone. How hard it was about the slippers,
I suppose only a woman can understand. You
see Elsa von Stuttgart has pretty feet, small and
dainty feet. Every other woman in her set has German
feet. “Look at them,” she whispered to me at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kaffee klatch</i> one day in 1914. And I did. And
I knew why her soul loved little satin slippers better
than Beethoven or Lizst. She has them now once
more. The house with the grand piano is closed
and her husband is with his regiment. Elsa von
Stuttgart in a class room is lecturing on philosophy
again. She has rented a small apartment the walls
of which are lined with books. You think the slippers
a luxury for war-time perhaps? Well, she
wrote me that she has done penance for them in
extra meatless days to atone for the price.</p>

<p>In France the Countess Madelaine de Ranier
lived in a château of the old aristocracy. And she
had a fortune of hundreds of thousands of francs
but not a sou to spend as she pleased. You would
have thought that she had everything that heart
could wish, until you caught unawares the wistful
expression in her eyes when they forgot their smiling.
Madelaine de Ranier, having no children of
her own, would have loved to write checks for the
charities that took care of other people’s children.
But she couldn’t. It was a very large dot that she
had brought to her husband. But by the laws of
France he administered it. Out of the income, he
of course paid her bills. The third year of her
marriage there occurred to her the idea for a confidential
arrangement which she made with her dressmaker
for doubling on the bills submitted for her
evening gowns and dividing the proceeds accruing.
It was the Countess’ only source of ready money.
She kept it in the secret drawer of her jewel case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
these few francs that she could count her own,
among her costly articles of adornment valued at
thousands. To-day the Count is somewhere on the
Somme and Madelaine de Ranier is daily at a desk
in Paris directing the great commercial house in
which her dot and the family fortune are invested.
I saw her in the winter of 1917. Her eyes were
sparkling. From the large income that she now
handles, she had just written off a contribution to
the Orphans of France Fund for the nation. And
nobody had said, “You must not,” or equally as authoritatively,
“I do not wish it.”</p>

<p>In England there is Edith Russell, Dr. Edith Russell
she really is. She gave up her profession when
she married, to devote herself wholly to home making
in the great house in Cavendish Square, London.
It requires nine servants and careful planning to
meet the expenses, even though her husband turns
over to her all of his income. “Can’t we go out
to Hampstead to a smaller house instead?” she asked
him one day, laying her housekeeping accounts before
him. She was trying somehow to plan for a
financial surplus. The Malthusian League was in
need of funds and she used to be one of its most
earnest workers. But her husband said: “Not at
all.” Even if there were indeed hundreds of pounds
available, he did not approve of the League’s principles
anyhow. Now Dr. Edith Russell in response
to her country’s call is back on the staff of the borough
health department in the medical work in which
she was engaged before her marriage. And she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
again a Malthusian League contributor. You see,
it’s her own money now, not her husband’s.</p>

<p>Up in the north of England there is a factory
town where the largest works in November, 1914,
hung out a notice that any women who before their
marriage had been employed there would be taken
back. Mrs. Webber was. The regular weekly
wage is so much better than the occasional charing
which was all that she had been able to get to supplement
her husband’s frequent unemployment.
Her children are among those who have been since
the war transferred at school from the free list to
the paid dinners. Before the war there were 11,000
children in this town to be supplied with free school
dinners. Now since their mothers work outside the
home, this figure has dropped to 2,370. Mrs. Webber
also is one of those women who have been shopping.
All over Europe they have been doing it.
From Petrograd to Berlin and Paris and London,
delighted shop keepers report that women who never
had money before are spending it. The curate in
the parish to which Mrs. Webber belongs—Mrs.
Webber used to char for his wife, but is no longer
available—told me that these working classes have
gone perfectly mad about money and the reckless
expenditure of it. And I asked him how and he
said: “Why cheese, they all of them have it for
supper now. And the woman in that house, the
third from the end of the row,” he pointed it out
from his study window, “has a fur coat.” It was
Mrs. Webber’s house the curate mentioned.</p>

<p class="center">HIS PERSONALITY—AND HERS</p>

<p>Well now, you see, to Elsa von Stuttgart in Berlin,
it may be little satin evening slippers, and to
Madelaine de Ranier in Paris it may be orphans of
France, and to Dr. Edith Russell in London it may
be the great reform for which the Malthusian League
is organised, and to Mrs. Webber it may be school
dinners and cheese and a fur coat—but to all of them
it’s economic independence. Mrs. Webber says, “A
shilling of your own is worth two that ’e gives you.”
Edith Russell and the rest I have not heard say it.
But from Countess to char woman, you see, this
about the wage envelope is certain: It’s yours to
burn if you care to—or to buy with it what you
choose! There are millions of women over this war
racked world who have it to-day, who never had it
before. And the hand that holds this new wage envelope
holds the future of the race in its keeping.
Not since that magna charta that the barons wrested
from King John, has so powerful a guarantee of
liberty been won. It carries with it all the freedoms
that the feminists have ever formulated. She who
stepped out of the Doll’s House stands at the threshold
of a new earth. Something very much more
than little satin slippers and books and fur coats
and their own money is coming to women!</p>

<p>Let us see. You would have been astounded, I
believe, if Elsa von Stuttgart had attempted to dictate
to her husband his hats or his slippers. Anyway,
Herr von Stuttgart would. You would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
have expected Edith Russell to have suggested across
the breakfast table: “My dear, the propaganda of
such and such a society to which you belong is not
pleasing to me. I do not care to have you support
it.” Why, either gentleman would have been a
henpecked husband to have permitted any such interference
with his personal liberty. Not even in
America would any wife so presume to dare. It is
quite likely that a lady living in New York could
announce over the coffee cups, “My dear, we will
move to Long Island to-day.” And the voice behind
the newspaper would probably agree without
a demurrer, “I’ll be out on the 4:30 train.” Probably
also he has never heard how many pairs of
slippers she has, and all he knows about her hats
is their price. But after all, it is only by the privilege
he permits her that the lady can put it over
like this. At any moment that he cares to assert it,
he still holds the balance of power in this household.</p>

<p>Because man and wife are one, he who carries the
purse is the one. It’s only the new purse in the
family that can alter the situation anywhere in the
world. She who carries it is another one, with her
personal liberty too. In the last analysis, it is only
a person who can pay the rent who can talk with
assertion about where “we” shall live and how.</p>

<p>No economist in any university chair understands
this any more clearly than does Mrs. Webber, who
once lived in two rooms and now lives in three <em>because
she can pay the rent</em>! The new purse in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
family has raised the whole scale of living for her
and for her children. Yesterday her personality was
merged and submerged in that of a husband to whose
standard of maintenance she was limited. To-day
she is emerging with a wage envelope in her hand
and a personality of her own, as is likewise Elsa von
Stuttgart and Edith Russell and Madelaine de
Ranier. Society may be tremendously startled to
find them at last counted so that one and one in the
marriage relation shall make two. When in this
great world war, that autocracy with its divine right
of kings that has ruled and wrecked civilisation shall
have been swept from the throne, there is another
autocracy with its “divine” authority of one sex over
the other that is going into the scrap-heap of old
systems.</p>

<p>Through the events of these war days already it
is clear that such an eternal purpose runs. Nobody
thought of it when woman was called from the home
in all lands. But there has really begun the casting
off of that ancient chrysalis of “coverture.” Have
you by chance yet met among your acquaintances
the woman who is refusing to part with her own
name? Mary McArthur, the great English labour
leader, is the wife of Mr. Anderson, a member of
Parliament and she is the mother of a baby. But
she has never ceased to be herself. “You call yourself
Miss McArthur,” a curious inquirer remarked to
her one day, “and yet they say your cook tells that
you are very respectable.”</p>

<p>There are numbers of women like this in London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
and in New York, who are preferring their own identity
to that of their husbands. The German and
Scandinavian women going a little farther say, “Let
us at mature age take an adult title.” Master Jones,
you know, does not wait for the day of his marriage
to emerge from his adolescence as “Mr.” Jones,
Fraulein is but a diminutive, “little Frau,” a prefix
of immaturity. Rosika Schwimmer, touring America
for a lecture bureau, assured inquiring reporters:
“Of course I am Frau Schwimmer. Why shouldn’t
I be? I have passed my 35th birthday.” The Imperial
Union of Women Suffragists of Germany in
convention assembled, not long ago decided to adopt
the adult title Frau for all women of mature age, the
“unity title,” they call it. In this first faint stirring,
there is significance of wide changes.</p>

<p>She whose identity had so disappeared at the altar,
that the law actually wrote her down on the statute
books as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">civiliter mortua</i>, one “civilly dead,” is about
to be restored to the status of an individual. The
long road, along which the woman movement of yesterday
made its slow way, is now at the sharpest
turning.</p>

<p>The struggle of women in all lands to be released
from the discriminations that have limited their human
activities set free the spinster some time ago.
The point of view that is now generally accepted
about her, and without contravention in the most
advanced countries, was most definitely formulated
some sixty years ago in Scandinavia. There they
put on the statute books a law abolishing the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
male guardianship over unmarried women and
permitting a person “of staid age and character” to
manage her own affairs. At first this was a privilege
to be granted only on special appeal to the king.
But at last the right of self-government at 21 was
established for all unmarried women. So radical a
departure from custom was of course not accomplished
without misgivings. There were those who
feared that for a woman to manage her own affairs,
was not in accordance with true womanly dignity and
the dictates of religion. They said, The majority of
women do not want it. Why, then, give them a
responsibility they do not wish or ask for? But in
spite of those objections, the spinster came to be recognised
as a responsible individual.</p>

<p>For so long now has the world been accustomed to
seeing her going about, doing as she pleases almost
as any other adult, that we have forgotten that she
ever couldn’t. She can acquire education. She can
own property. She has been able for some time now
to get into a great many occupations and professions:
only her difficulty was to get up. And there has
been that limitation to her income. It has remained
stationary at a figure seldom passing two-thirds that
of a man’s income. The teaching profession affords
statistics that are world-wide testimony to the situation
that has prevailed from, say, Newark, N. J., to
Archangel, Russia: there have been women school
teachers working for a less wage than the man school
janitor: there have been women professors at the
head of high school departments at a salary less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
that of the men subordinates whom they directed.
Still, in all of her personal affairs, a spinster in every
country has been for a long time now as free as the
rest of the people.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">SIGNING AWAY HER FREEDOM</p>

<p>Then, on the day that the ring is slipped on her
finger, she has put her name to a contract that has
more or less signed away her liberty, according to the
part of the world in which she happens to live. In
Finland, for instance, where the position of women
has been in many respects as advanced as anywhere
in the world, even a woman member of Parliament
at her marriage reverts to type, as it were: though
she still sits in Parliament, she passes under the
guardianship of her husband! In Sweden, she lost
her vote: for that country, in 1862 the first to grant
the municipal franchise to women, cautiously withheld
it until 1909 from married women. There is,
indeed, almost no land in which marriage does not
in some way limit for the rest of her life a woman’s
participation in world affairs. She may have lost
property rights, personal rights, political rights, or
perhaps she has lost her job, her right to work and
be paid for it. At any rate, she must look around to
determine how many of these things may have happened
to her. Any of them that haven’t, are special
exemptions from that universal ruling of all nations
that a woman on marriage enters into a state of
coverture, with its accompanying legal disability.
“Disability” is defined by Dicey’s “Digest” as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
“status of being an infant, lunatic, or married woman.”
And there you are.</p>

<p>It was from that predicament that the earliest
woman’s rights’ associations sought to extricate the
woman who had taken the wedding veil and ring.
Susan B. Anthony’s first most famous achievement
back in the sixties was a law establishing the right
of a married woman in New York State to the ownership
of her own clothes! By specific enactments
since then, one and another of the rights to which
other human beings are naturally born have been
bestowed on married women. The most clearly defined
of these, and the most widely recognised at last,
are the right to their separate property and the right
to their own earnings, which prevails in most of the
United States. The Married Women’s Property
Act accomplished it in England. In France, after
14 years of agitation for it, <abbr title="Madame">Mme</abbr>. Jeanne Schmall
and the Société l’Avant Courriere in 1907 at last
secured the law giving to the married woman the free
disposition of her salary. But these concessions it
is not easy to disentangle from that basic notion,
which is warp and woof of the whole fabric of law,
that a married woman has passed under the guardianship
of her husband.</p>

<p>For in Germany and Scandinavia and France,
“separate property” to ensure her title to it, must be
specially secured to her by an antenuptial contract.
In Sweden, her earnings are hers, only if they remain
in cash. In France she is permitted to invest them
in bonds, provided first she either makes affidavit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
before a notary proving her ownership or brings a
written permit from her husband. In the State of
Washington, the supreme attempt to confer equality
on woman finds expression in the statute: “All
laws which impose or recognise civil disabilities upon
a wife which are not imposed or recognised as existing
as to the husband, are abolished.” But in spite
of that most laudable effort, the end is not yet attained.
For the State of Washington is still enmeshed
in the community property system, by which
the management and control of the common property
in marriage is vested in the husband. And although
the law has been distinctly framed that a married
woman is entitled to her own earnings, it practically
takes them away from her by requiring her to count
them in with the community property which is under
her husband’s control. The atomic theory, you see,
was not more firmly fixed in science than is this idea
that has been embedded in the social structure that
a married woman is legally, civilly, and politically
a minor!</p>

<p>Even in these United States, where the mention of
the “subjection of woman” raises a smile, so largely
has it by the grace of the American man been permitted
to become a dead letter, the <em>employment</em> of
married women has remained against public policy.
Many boards of education have by-laws about it.
Even these women teachers who commit matrimony
and conceal it are almost invariably later on detected
and dropped from the pay roll when found
guilty of maternity. Business houses have shared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
in the prejudice. A Chicago bank as lately as 1913
adopted a rule requiring the resignation of woman
employés on marriage. Because the married woman,
the bank president said, “should be at home, not at
a typewriter or an adding machine.” Similarly a
United States civil service regulation reads: “No
married woman will be appointed to a classified position
in the postal service, nor will any woman occupying
a classified position in the postal service be
reappointed to such position when she shall marry.”</p>

<p>A world has been arranged, you see, on the assumption
of the complete eclipse of the personality
of the married woman—with the burden resting on
her to disprove it in the legal situations where she
has come to be recognised as an individual. Custom
prefers that a married woman should be a dependent
person. It was an idea that fifty years of feminist
bombardment had not dislodged from the popular
mind. Now in four years of war, it has crumbled.</p>

<p>“Women wanted,” called the world in need,
wanted even though married! And out of the seclusion
and separation to which she was hitherto consigned,
the woman with the ring has come to find
her wage envelope. All regulations against her employment
are now rescinded in Europe, as soon they
will be here. The working woman in particular has
been given her release. The state, you remember,
will now cook her meals and care for her children.
And it was all a mistake that attributed infant mortality
to the industrial employment of mothers.
Now it is found that a wife’s wage envelope really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
reduces infant mortality by improving environment.
There will be fewer of Mrs. Webber’s children, you
know, dying in three rooms than in two!</p>

<p>The ban on the married woman in the civil service
and in the professions is lifted. The Association of
Austrian Women’s Organisations in their 1916 convention
passed the resolution demanding the abolition
of the “celibacy clause” for women office holders.
And although no country has as yet formally
erased this from the statute books, governments have
at least tacitly consented to remember it no more
against a woman that she has married. That is why
Dr. Edith Russell is again practising medicine in the
public health service and Prof. Elsa von Stuttgart
is teaching philosophy. Especially in medicine is it
recognised that the married woman physician is more
than ever fitted for a part in the campaign for the
conservation of child life. And if she is also a
mother, so much the better. Why was it never
thought of before? Of course a person who has had
a baby is the real expert who knows more about it
than the person who never can have one. Women
formerly dropped from the civil service on account
of marriage have been recalled all over Europe.
Even Germany has opened to them post, telegraph,
and railway positions. So many masters in Germany’s
upper high schools are at the front, that married
women have been called to these positions.
Hundreds of married women have been reinstated
in the school rooms of England. Detroit, Mich.,
the other day repealed its regulations which forbade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
the employment of married women as teachers in the
public schools. It is Russia that has led all lands
in her recognition of the woman teacher, not only
refusing longer to penalise her for marriage but
actually, as we have seen, establishing for her the
principle of equal pay for equal work.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MINOR</p>

<p>Like this, the married woman has to-day been
welcomed in industry, in commerce, and in the professions.
This person of affairs abroad in the world
a minor! It is more than a disability that she herself
must endure. It becomes an annoyance to the
world to have her so. According to Bacon’s
Abridgement, a very imposing volume, it is still
written that “the law looks upon husband and wife
but as one person and therefore allows but of one
will between them, which is placed in the husband.”
But you see what a far cry it is from the woman in
London or Paris or Berlin to “the one” on the western
front. How is she to “obey” that man in the
Vosges or on the Somme since she cannot have
telegraphic communication about her daily movements?
And without it, the French woman was left
in a helpless tangle in the Napoleonic code.</p>

<p>Madelaine de Ranier at the head of a great business
concern in Paris found herself forbidden to sign
a check, unable to open a bank account. The Count
had enlisted on the second day after war was declared
and he had left with her a sum of gold.
When it was exhausted and she faced the need of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
funds, she was unable to negotiate a loan on valuable
bonds that she owned. Oh, the bonds were all
right. The difficulty was that she was a married
woman. And though very rich, she nevertheless
was obliged to turn to friends who relieved her immediate
financial necessities. Now in the drawer
of her office desk there is a legal paper bearing the
seal of France: across the bottom is printed “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
pour autorisation maritale</i>” and beneath is the
Count’s signature. Until he had consented to make
this arrangement, sending on from the front this
“authorisation of the husband,” she was prohibited
from transacting any business. For a married
woman in France might not sell property or mortgage
it or acquire it or sign a business contract or
go to law without the consent of her husband!
Women acting temporarily as mayors of some of
the French villages, from which almost the entire
male population has been mobilised, have found it
necessary in order to execute municipal papers to
turn to a male citizen for his signature, even though
he might not be able to write and could only make
his mark. Finally in 1916, the situation came up,
for legal decision. The validity of a building contract
entered into by a French woman was questioned
in court. The judge after mature deliberation
rendered a decision that although the woman
was not empowered to sign the contract, yet as she
had acted with the tacit consent of her husband and
in his interest and that of the country, the court
would uphold the validity of the act. “It is necessary,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
he said, “that for the welfare of France,
women shall take the place of men and perform
duties which have hitherto been considered outside
their sphere.” The Union Fraternelle des Femmes at
once began pressing Parliament for the removal from
the statute books of the requirement for “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maritale
autorisation</i>.” And not long ago the Chamber of
Deputies passed the bill granting to married women
for the period of the war, permission to demand from
the courts the right to do without this legal formality.
Italy in 1917 completely swept away this same
ancient restriction. The bill introduced by the Italian
Minister of Justice, Signor Sacchi, abrogated not
only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maritale autorisation</i>, but “every other law
which in the field of civil and commercial rights
curtails the capacities of Italian women.” Speaking
for the measure in Parliament, Signor Sacchi
declared it an “act of justice—of reparation almost,
to which women have now more right than ever.”</p>

<p>But these civil disabilities have not been limited
to Latin countries. You may find them anywhere
as a hang-over from past ages. It is simply the
natural corollary to that old doctrine of coverture
that the acts of the dependent person should lack
authority before the law. Even in the State of
Washington, a wife may not sue alone in a court of
law to recover personal damages: her husband must
join with her in the suit. Everywhere in the professions
and in business, woman’s progress has been
blocked because the courts, looking into the law
books, found the status of this person in question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
If her protected position more or less prevents her
from entering into legal contracts, doubt is cast on
all of her agreements. What prudent business man
would wish to engage in a business transaction with
her? There are provisions of the Married Women’s
Property Act in England, which make her not liable
to imprisonment for refusal to pay her debts. And
who would choose to be represented in a court of law
by an advocate who, though to-day in clear possession
of all of her capacities, may to-morrow cease to
be “responsible” before the law? For any woman,
though not yet married, is always subject to that
liability! That was what the courts of the United
States decided when the first women began to apply
for admission to the legal profession. And it is to
correct the position in which women are placed by
the common law that their admission to the practice
of law in America has been by the slow process of an
“enabling act” from State to State. In England,
where this common law still bars the way, their present
appeal now before Parliament is significantly entitled
“A Bill to remove disqualifications on the
ground of sex or marriage for the admission of persons
as solicitors.”</p>

<p>There is still another “disability” which is causing
to-day perhaps the most world-wide concern of
all. A spectacular figure has been silhouetted
against the background of the great war. In the
tranquil days of peace, a woman might have been
all her life married to a man of differing nationality
without making the discovery that she had thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
lost her own: by law when she married, she became
of her husband’s nationality. When the troops
began to march in 1914, a wife like this suddenly
found herself a woman without a country. Frightened
English women married to Germans resident in
London, panic-stricken German women married to
Englishmen who happened to be resident in Berlin,
knew not which way to turn for a haven from the
terrors of war. Pronounced aliens in their home
land, their position was even worse than that of, the
woman of actual enemy birth who was stranded in
a foreign country when the war burst. She could at
least go home. But where should a woman who
was married to an enemy alien go?</p>

<p>Her own country turned on her coldly with the
declaration, His people are your people. And nowhere
in the world would she be so little welcome
as among his people now at war with and bitterly
hostile to hers. There are instances where these
women have been obliged to find refuge in neutral
countries. In some lands they have been permitted
to remain in the place of their birth, but under police
espionage. A man and his wife, you know, are one.
And if he controls her absolutely, from her slippers
to her principles, is it likely that she will dare to be
a free agent in her war sympathies? As a matter of
fact, this war has developed that she is always more
or less under the cold suspicion even of relatives and
neighbours, of having along with the loss of her own
nationality lost also her patriotism. Who shall say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
but that in obedience to her husband she may be a
spy? I stood at the desk in the Bow Street Police
Station registering my arrival in London one war
day, when a timid voice of inquiry at my side also
addressed the sergeant: “I want to ask,” she said
diffidently, “if I could possibly have my mail sent
here to police headquarters? You see, it’s letters
from my husband interned here in England because
he’s a German. I’m an English woman. But every
boarding house in London where I try to live, as soon
as that envelope marked ‘Enemy Internment Camp’
arrives in my mail, turns me out.”</p>

<p>Like this, the “alien wife” has to be shunted about
in many lands to-day. Even a woman who has not
so lost her nationality may not travel without all of
the credentials of her marital status to establish it.
If you apply for a passport at Washington, you are
asked for your husband’s birth certificate and under
some conditions your marriage certificate. A married
man is not asked for his. Why this inquiry into
your personal affairs? Because it is tacitly assumed
that you are so under the authority of another person
that there is no knowing what he may make you do.
By all law and religion you have been taught to obey
him. Then if he told you to blow up a ship, would
you? The only way to make sure that you are a
“safe” person to be at large, is to make sure of your
husband’s loyalty. For your identity is not your
own, you see, it’s his. If he happens to be French
or Russian or German or Hottentot, so you must be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WOMAN’S COMING OF AGE</p>

<p>That’s the way that men have made the world.
Now see it beginning to be made over. Women
everywhere are crying out in their conventions and
associations that the married woman’s own nationality
should be restored to her. America is the first
country to take action about it. And here, because
women have arrived at the halls of government, it is
more than resolution and petition. The United
States Congress has before it a bill proposing the
repeal of the law compelling women to relinquish
their American citizenship on marriage to foreigners.
The bill was introduced, let us note, by the Hon.
Jeanette Rankin, the first woman to be a member
of the national law-making body.</p>

<p>What was it man said a little while ago: “You
do not need a vote, my dear. I will represent you
in government and make the laws for you.” So all
over the world he did. But isn’t it plain now that
he made a mess of some of the laws he made for her?
It is a conviction that has crystallised simultaneously
in all countries that woman in her present independent
sphere of activity has won her right to self-determination
in all matters personally important to
her. That is why measures for her enfranchisement
are so universally under way. Let her vote for herself.
Let her represent herself. No one else has
been able successfully to do this for her. And it
may be that now she will be able to make better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
arrangements for herself than others have for her
in this world where certainly a great deal has gone
wrong.</p>

<p>So we have arrived at woman’s coming of age.
She who used to be by the most ancient family law
passed as a chattel from the guardianship of a father
to that of a husband, is now to be an individual. It
is only now that she could be. In a way they were
right yesterday who refused to regard her as a responsible
person. For she wasn’t. Under the coercion
of coverture, she even had to think the way that
pleased the person who paid her bills! To-day with
a wage envelope in one hand and a ballot in the
other, she is as much of a human being as any one
else is. As such, she is in a position to find the full
status of her own personality. For the first time
since history began, she will be under no one else’s
authority.</p>

<p>No greater revolution than this will have been
wrought by the Great World War. It is going to
be safe to permit to wives in all lands that they
retain their own nationality. The reason is clear:
because no one can compel this new woman, even
though she is a wife, to be a spy, or anything else
that she does not wish to be. <em>Or anything else that
she does not wish to be!</em></p>

<p>In those words, the woman movement of to-day
full-throated carols a hope for humanity that has
not echoed before in all the epics or the sagas or the
inspired revelations since the fall of man. Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
giveth this woman in marriage? She who was a
bondwoman now is free. And church and state
shall hear her terms!</p>

<p>Oh, yes, they shall! For a reform of the institution
on which society rests is all that will prevent a
rebellion against it. What do women want? This
woman who turns the ring on her finger? Read the
publications that during the past decade have said:
<cite>The Free Woman</cite>, edited by Dora Marsden in England;
Minna Cauer’s <cite>Die Frauenbewegung</cite> and
Marie Stritt’s <cite>Die Frauenfrage</cite> and Helene Stocker’s
<cite>Die Neue Generation</cite> in Germany; <cite>La Française</cite>,
edited by Jane Misme in France; and Margaret
Sanger’s <cite>The Woman Rebel</cite> in New York; the teachings
of Dr. Alice Vickerey in London and of Dr.
Aletta Jacobs in Amsterdam. There were even
women in the radical vanguard of that woman movement
of yesterday who were ready to end marriage
if it were not mended.</p>

<p>The world—and man who made it—had no adequate
conception of the hurt that was smothered and
smouldering in the heart of her over whom he exercised
his dominion and power. Windows were heard
smashing in England. Over in Germany there
had begun a breaking with less noise about it, so that
the world in general did not know. In the Kaiser’s
kingdom right in the face of the mailed fist, traditions
not to be so easily repaired as glass were being
shattered. But it was the suffragette outburst in
London that caught public attention. Thoughtful
men who honestly wanted to know—and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
could understand—turned to each other with the
question, Why do women do this? And no man
could tell.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, come with me. There is sitting in
Westminster in 1910 a Royal Commission on Marriage
and Divorce. Not yet even have their findings
changed English law. But the commission was appointed
to make inquiry into these matters in response
to a rising feeling of unrest over the present
arrangements. Witnesses, to give evidence that it
may be determined what ought to be done, are in
1910 being called. This government commission, it
should be noted, quite contrary to precedent, includes
among the churchmen and statesmen who have been
appointed to decide the question, also two women.
One of them, the Lady Francis Balfour, is interrogating
a witness whom she has summoned to the
stand because she has a particular point that she
wishes to elucidate. He is the Bishop of Birmingham,
whose church insists that at marriage the woman
passes indissolubly into the power of the husband.
To the man, it is permitted that he may divorce her
for adultery. But so long as these two shall live,
not even for that offence on his part may she have
release. He may beat her. He may flay her soul.
But she is his—unless she gets all of these details
spread on the public records and the judges of the
courts decide that there are enough of them legally
to constitute “cruelty.” Then, for adultery together
with this cruelty on the part of a husband, a few
English women have been allowed divorce. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
is very difficult and very expensive and very offensive
to the clergy when it has been actually accomplished.</p>

<p>The Lady Francis Balfour is speaking. To the
Bishop of Birmingham she is saying: “Let me take
a concrete case. You may have a woman who is a
Christian and you may have her husband ill using
her in some sort of way. We have had evidence
put before us, which is of course known to us all,
that there are even men who live on the prostitution
of their wives. Now, is that not a contract which
has been broken on the one side in the worst possible
way? Are they twain one flesh? Is that for better
and for worse?”</p>

<p>Bishop of Birmingham: “Yes, I am afraid so.”</p>

<p>Lady Francis Balfour: “And is that wife to stick
to that husband, she being a Christian, and to do as
he commands her?”</p>

<p>Bishop of Birmingham: “Yes, I am afraid so.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">WHAT WOULD MEN HAVE DONE?</p>

<p>That’s all, gentlemen. You and I will go.
There will be other witnesses and days of testimony.
But isn’t this enough? What would you yourselves
do if your church and your state handed you over
body and soul, like this, to any other human being
to have and to hold and to exercise this power and
dominion over you? I don’t believe you’d ever stop
at all to parade and respectfully to petition about it.
I think you’d be mobbing and rioting and bombing
right away. And if they had arrested you and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
you in Holloway Jail, you’d have raised the roof
and torn down the whole social structure!</p>

<p>Well, in England women broke windows. In
Germany, as I have said, they broke more. “Your
statutes have limited the liberties of the woman who
marries. Then you shall never limit us,” was the
gauntlet thrown down to society by the extremists.
They were university women, some of them with
doctor of philosophy degrees, who scathingly refused
the ring and faced free love instead. They were
quite frank about it—and quite fearless. I have
talked with them there in Berlin. They looked at
me as clear eyed, when they told me of what they
had done, as any women who have walked ringed
and veiled down a church aisle into legal wedlock.
Well, they seemed to think it was the only way, to
act directly instead of to agitate.</p>

<p>And they got out the book of the church ritual
that they had repudiated. And they turned to a
paragraph and said to me, Read. And I read:
“The woman’s will, as God says, shall be subject to
the man and he shall be her master: that is, the
woman shall not live according to her free will ...
and must neither begin nor complete anything without
the man. Where he is, there must she be and
bend before him as her master, whom she shall fear
and to whom she shall be subject and obedient.”</p>

<p>So I write it here, gentlemen, for you to see. And
again, I submit, What would you do if they had
said it that way to you? Be fair. Could any ring
have held you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span></p>

<p>It was natural, I think, that revolt should be most
bitter in England and in Germany, the two countries
where women were driven to the verge of desperation.
A Frenchman may hold the reins of his authority
so gaily that a woman with skill evades them.
And the dear American man will pass them right
over to you if you’re a woman of any judgment and
<em>finesse</em> at all. But in those lands where a wife must
not only promise to obey, but also they made her, the
eruption was due. Action and reaction are equal in
the old law of physics, and you can pretty accurately
measure the rebound by that. It was because the
ring hurt worse in Germany than anywhere else in
the world, that they just tore it off. But the marriage
strike that was started in Germany wasn’t
staying there.</p>

<p>In nearby Sweden, a woman who is a very prominent
lawyer and a man who is a university professor,
decided to do with an announcement in a newspaper
instead of a ceremony in a church—and the lady
remains a lawyer. It was the only way that she
could. The law of that land places the woman, on
the day that she marries, under her husband’s guardianship,
and pronounces her incompetent thereafter
to act as an attorney in court! The newspaper announcement
as it is now used in Scandinavia is
called the “conscience marriage.”</p>

<p>There were also Anglo-Saxon women who had
rebelled. In London, an Oxford graduate who had
done with window breaking told me quite candidly
that she was living what she called the “unorthodox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
life.” And there were others in her particular London
suburb. In New York City, even, there are
women who have preferred the “free union.”</p>

<p>You see how near it was to being wrecked, this an
institution more revered by society than all of the
cathedrals and art galleries. Only this war, probably,
could have averted the disaster. Now this
new woman, with her wage envelope and her vote,
has become articulate. She can speak as one who
can pay the rent, about how “we” shall live.</p>

<p>Oh, it’s not either Hampstead or Long Island.
Never mind for a while whether the lace curtains
will be long enough or shall the floors be done over.
Yesterday her domain was the home. To-day it’s
the wide, wide world to be set to order. For the
first time she’s facing her destiny, with the right to
decide more than the parlour carpet or her satin slippers
or even her sociological principles.</p>

<p>How “we” shall live and love together, is the
question for consultation. And there is statute and
dogma and custom and convention and tradition to
be done over. These have been handed down until
they are many of them past all usefulness. Some of
them are moth-eaten and quite outworn. None of
them, please note this, gentlemen, none of them is
of her selection. Just think of that. There’s not a
code in the world that was formulated by a woman.
The creeds that have come from Rome and Wittenberg
and Westminster were not even submitted for
woman’s inspection. And marriage was made for
her by law courts and church councils to which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
was not even asked. There was not so much as a
by-your-leave to the lady, in the matter of her most
intimate personal concern. Oh, isn’t this clearly
where the reconstruction of civilisation shall commence?</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">MAKING OVER MARRIAGE</p>

<p>Only for the man in khaki to come home again it
waits. Then with the new woman, together at last,
they can build the new world aright. For never
again shall we permit any such skewed and twisted
and one-sided job as that of the past. “Dear,” she
will say, “you did it as well as you could, probably,
that old world. But the trouble was, that you did
it alone.”</p>

<p>And with a little whimsical smile, she’ll quote for
him the old proverb that “two heads are better than
one.” Then perhaps they will walk in the garden
in the evening. And with her hand in his arm, she
will speak as she never could speak before—as a
free woman who has found her soul! There were
things, I think, that God forgot when he talked to
Moses and to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul. But now he’s told them to
her.</p>

<p>Listen: “Marriage,” she will say, “marriage,
dear, we must make over so that it shall be something
very sweet and very sacred.”</p>

<p>Oh, it wasn’t always that yesterday. There are
women who know it wasn’t. When a man could
say to the woman the law gave to him, “Come unto
me to-night, or I shall not give you money with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
which to buy shoes for the children to-morrow.” Or
he may have said, “the slippers for your pretty feet”—when
marriage was that way, everything in it
divine just died! It shall never be so again.</p>

<p>Hear the new woman. “We shall have more love
about marriage and less law,” she will say. “And
we shall never let them lock us in. Love always
laughed even yesterday at the clumsy locksmiths
who thought they had bolted and barred the Doll’s
House with ordinance and ritual. For how love
cometh, we may not say, who are mute before so
much as the mystery of the tint of the rose or the
perfume of the lilies in June. Nor how love goeth,
dare we define. Presumptuous mortals who have
thought to hold back love with law and enactment,
have made of marriage an empty form, echoing with
the mockery of the happiness that fled.”</p>

<p>Well, we will say that she is talking like this under
the stars. The next morning at breakfast she will
come right to the point. And I know where she
will begin. “That old doctrine of coverture,” she
will say, “take it away!” There is a place for the
relics of an antiquated civilisation. In the museum
of the Tower of London they have in a glass case
the little model of the rack and thumb screw. The
executioner’s block and the headsman’s axe is an important
and impressive exhibit. And there are the
coats of mail of early warriors. It is customary, I
believe, to put there all things that are passing into
desuetude: a hansom cab went in the other day.
Now let them take also this ancient doctrine of coverture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
and put it in a glass case for future generations
to wonder at its barbarity. Then may the marriage
contract be rewritten with a really free hand.</p>

<p>How it will be done all over the world, we even
at present may prophesy. See already Scandinavia.
The northern sky was alight with the forecast of
woman’s freedom, even before this war broke. Contemporaneously
with the enfranchisement of women
up there, completed in Denmark only in 1915, almost
the first act of governments in which all of the
people were for the first time represented, was to
appoint a marriage commission. On it are both
men and women from the three lands, Norway, Denmark,
and Sweden. It is still at work revising the
marriage laws. The task is not completed. But
there are important sections of the new code ready:
they have taken the “obey” out of the marriage service;
they have stipulated for divorce by mutual consent,
that is by request of the parties interested, who
are to be let out of wedlock as simply and as easily
as they were let in. Further personal rights and
property rights are all being defined and arranged
on the new basis of equality of morality and duty
and responsibility and on the assumption that the
wife is a separate personality from her husband.</p>

<p>The nearby country of Finland, where the woman
movement has always kept step with Scandinavia,
has also taken similar action. The Law Committee
of the Finnish Parliament had in 1917 appealed to
local authorities and other qualified bodies for suggestions
on the subject of the reform of the marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
laws. Seven women’s associations united in formulating
the pronouncement which was returned.
There is no paragraph about divorce for the reason
that Finland has already accomplished divorce by
mutual consent. For the rest, it is probably the
most complete presentment available of the new
woman’s point of view. This is what she asks:—</p>

<p>1. That the guardianship of the husband shall
cease, and the married woman have an equal right
of action in all legal matters, even against her husband;
that she shall have the right to plead in courts
of law and to carry on business independently.</p>

<p>2. That the married couple shall have equal responsibilities
and rights as regards the children and
provide for them together.</p>

<p>3. That the husband and wife shall have equal
right to represent the family in public matters. If
either party uses this right improperly, it can be
taken from him or her by the courts on the demand
of the other party.</p>

<p>4. If either husband or wife should be a cause of
danger to the other, the party who is endangered
shall have the right to separate from the other. The
courts shall be empowered to decide whether the circumstances
are such as to entitle the complaining
party to receive maintenance.</p>

<p>5. That if a married couple separates, the party
who retains the care of the child shall decide the
question of the child’s education. If this right be
misused, the other party shall have the right to
appeal to the courts for rectification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span></p>

<p>6. That if any labour contract or business be conducted
by one of the parties to the detriment of the
family, the other party shall have the right of appeal
to the courts with the object of annulling the contract
or forbidding the business.</p>

<p>7. That in regard to the property of married
couples, there shall be three possible alternative
methods of arrangement: (a) Joint possession in
the case of earned income. (b) Joint possession of
every description of property. (c) Separation of
property.</p>

<p>8. Several points must be taken into consideration
in regard to the working of these different methods
of arrangement: (a) That the distinction between
real and other descriptions of property shall cease.
(b) That each party shall have control over his or
her separate property and the income derived from it
and over all earned income. (c) That each party
shall be bound to contribute to the maintenance of
the family in proportion to his or her means, either
in work or in financial resource. (d) That in case
of joint possession, the whole income, earned or unearned,
of each party shall belong to the common
family fund. (e) That in the case of joint possession,
both parties shall have equal rights of disposition.
These rights shall be used by them jointly in
such a manner that neither party shall be able to
dispose of the property without the consent of the
other, and no transaction can take place without the
consent of both parties. (f) That the party who
gives the chief labour and attention to the home shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
have a due share of the common property and of the
earned income, with full power to defray his or her
personal expenses and those of the home.</p>

<p>9. Before marriage, the contracting parties shall
agree on which of the three systems the property
shall be arranged. This agreement shall be capable
of alteration after marriage with due legal formalities
and safeguards.</p>

<p>10. Husband and wife shall inherit from each
other on the same footing with the children.</p>

<p>This memorial from the Finnish women coincides
perfectly in spirit with the new laws in process of
construction for Scandinavia. When the Dutch
Parliament, which has just conferred a new measure
of suffrage on the women of the Netherlands, was in
1917 debating the matter, an alarmed reactionary
rose to object: “But how can married women vote?
For married women are not free. They are like soldiers
in barracks, who have lost the liberty to express
their thoughts.”</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE NEW FATHERHOOD</p>

<p>Sir, that’s just the point. But the liberty that
was lost, is found. No one, as we have seen, is
going to compel this new woman to be anything that
she does not want to be. Let us not forget this now
as she goes on talking. For she is coming presently
to that which is at the heart of the whole woman
question, nay, more, the human question.</p>

<p>“Dear,” she is going to say, “there is that which
matters more than all the rest for us now to decide.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
It’s the children, the children are on my mind.”
Then she is going to emphasise how important it is
that parenthood shall be equalised. By the laws
that men have made about it, quite universally,
equally in fact in England and Germany and France
and Italy and Russia and the United States, the
father is the only parent. His will decides its religion,
its education, and all of the conditions under
which the child shall be reared. There are a few of
the United States, most notably those where women
vote and one or two others in which pressure has been
brought to bear by the feminists, where the law has
been corrected. Also in Scandinavia and in Australia,
as soon as women have come into the vote,
one of their first efforts has been to establish what is
known as “equal guardianship,” the right of a married
mother to her own child. To an unmarried
mother, by a strange perversity in the statutes of
men, is conceded not only all the right to the child
but there is put upon her all of the responsibility of
its parenthood.</p>

<p>The new woman is not going to rest content to
have it stand that way. Already the world is being
forced to a new deal for childhood. The sins of the
fathers are being lifted from the children on whom
society in the past has so heavily visited them. A
baby has broken no law. Why brand it, then, as
“illegitimate”? War babies crying in all lands
have brought statesmen to startled attention. Government
after government has arranged for what is
called the “separation allowance” to go to the woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
at home to whom the soldier at the front knows that
it belongs—even though she has no marriage lines to
show. So the War Office pen writes off one discrimination.
Of children who used to be called “illegitimate,”
50,000 born annually in England and 180,000
born annually in Germany will now be entitled
to start life with equal financial government aid that
the others get.</p>

<p>It is the first step in the direction of the new arrangements
about parenthood. The polite fiction
that used to pass, that there were any children without
fathers, is going to be ruled out of court. Of all
the laws that have been written that evidence the
difference in the point of view of men and women,
see the illegitimacy laws. Napoleon put it in his
code “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La recherche de la paternité est interdite</i>,”
and it was only in 1913 that the feminists of France,
led by Margaret Durand, succeeded in getting that
edict modified so that a woman in France is no
longer “forbidden” to look for the father of her
child. Up in Norway, where women vote, they put
on the statute books in 1915 a very different law:
it commands that the father of the child shall be
found. This is the famous law framed by Johan
Castberg, minister of justice, and inspired by his
sister-in-law, Fru Kathe Anker Moler. The draft
of the bill was submitted in advance to the women’s
clubs of the country: the National Women’s Council
of Norway stamped it with the seal of approval. So
that there can be no doubt but that it has put the
matter as a woman thinketh. Even the title of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
new law significantly omits all objectionable reference:
it is a “Law Concerning Children whose Parents
have not Married Each Other.” They are
equally entitled to a father’s name and support and
to an inheritance in his property as are any other
kind of children. The father must be found! Not
even if the paternity is a matter of doubt among
three men or six men or any several men, can any of
them, or all of them, escape behind “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exceptio plurium</i>,”
which in other lands affords them protection.
In Norway, they are every one of them a party to the
possible obligation. And the financial responsibility
of fathering the child in question is distributed <em>pro
rata</em> among them. What the Norwegian law accomplishes,
you see, is the abolition of anonymous paternity.</p>

<p>Like this, there is a great deal in the laws and the
religion and the public opinion of the world of yesterday
that will need revision. Lastly, there is that
which is of more significance than all the rest. Way
back in the beginning of things, the lady who was
called Eve, you remember as the Sunday school
lesson ran, got the world into a lot of trouble, it
was said, by eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.
Too little knowledge, some one else has told
us, may prove a dangerous thing. But there is a
Latin proverb on which a school of therapeutics is
founded, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Similia similibus curantur</i>.” Then, if
“like cures like,” what we need to-day is more
knowledge to make right the ancient wrong that
afflicts the earth! Well, we have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span></p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<p class="center">THE WHISPER OF GOD</p>

<p>This new woman will look back into the dear eyes
that search hers. In her level glance there will flash
an understanding of life that never was in woman’s
eyes before in all the ages of sorrow since the angel
fixed up the flaming swords that shut her out of
Eden. For in the white silence where she has found
her soul, she has heard even the closest whisper of
God. If man before missed it, why, maternity was
naturally the matter that he could not know and
could not understand. This is the new revelation,
<em>that maternity shall be made more divine</em>! There
has been a halo about it in song and picture and
story. But we want to put a halo on in London’s
east end and New York’s east side. Creation itself
is to be corrected.</p>

<p>Doesn’t it need to be? See how many men, it is
being discovered to-day, are not well enough made
for soldiers. England is obliged to reject 25% of
her men as physically unfit. America is reported to
have rejected 29%. The other nations cannot show
any better figures. If in the great arsenals that are
manufacturing munitions of war, one shell in four
turned out was spoiled, the industry would have to
be at once investigated and put on a more efficient
basis than that. Quite likely the mistake might be
discovered to be “speeding up.” There had been an
effort to turn out too many shells. If fewer shells
are made, they can be better made. And you will
get just as many in the end. For by the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
process, all these shells that fail, you see, do not
count in the real output.</p>

<p>It’s just like this about people. We’ve been trying
to have too many. When Mrs. Smith in London
or in New York or Frau Schmidt in Berlin, has
six or eight or more children in, say, two rooms,
some of them are going to have rickets and some of
them are going to have tuberculosis and some of them
are going into penal institutions. So that when you
come to want them for the army, you find that one
in four has failed. Why, even chickens would. A
poultry fancier does not presume to try to raise a
brood of chickens in quarters too crowded for their
development. He measures his poultry house and
determines how many chickens he can accommodate
with enough air and space—and how many he can
afford to feed. He limits the flock accordingly.
Mrs. Smith in London or New York and Frau
Schmidt in Berlin, can too!</p>

<p>Fire and electricity and other useful forces we have
long since obtained the mastery over and turned from
a menace to a blessing to mankind. But another
even mightier force has ravaged the world like unchained
lightning. Because it has not been controlled.
Men thought that it must not be. So the
fear of its consequences has haunted homes in every
land since the pronouncement, “I will greatly multiply
thy conceptions.” All of the great religious
teachers said that you must not take the misery out
of maternity. It was meant to be there. And science,
which had accomplished miracles in mitigating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
other suffering, stood afar off from the woman in
childbirth. So much as an anæsthetic to deaden the
pain was forbidden, until quite recent times, as an
interference with the will of the Almighty. It was
Queen Elizabeth of England who broke that taboo.
By virtue of her royal authority, she demanded chloroform.
And got it. Her daring could then, of
course, be followed by other women. Newer iconoclasts
are calling for twilight sleep, that achieves
maternity in a dream. Add birth control. And we
shall be out of the trouble in which the unhappy
lady called Eve so long ago involved all of her
daughters.</p>

<p>Birth control means, instead of a maternity that
is perpetual, unregulated and haphazard and miserable,
a maternity that is intelligently directed and
limited. So that it shall be volitional. The rising
value of a baby at last requires that people shall be
as carefully produced as the shells we are making
with such infinite accuracy. Most of all, it is important
that there shall not be too many babies lest
some of them not well done shall be only worthless
and good for nothing. You see, you have to think
about quality as well as quantity when you are
counting for a final output. Russia, which had a
birth rate of 50 per thousand, the highest birth rate
in Europe, is the nation whose military defences have
crumpled like paper. It was France, with a birth
rate of 28 per thousand, the lowest in Europe, that
held the line for civilisation at the Marne. And it
was Germany, which has always imposed on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
women as a national service the speeding up of population,
that plunged the world into the agony of this
war. Because 55% of the families of Berlin live in
one-room tenements and there is nowhere to put
the babies that have kept on coming, Germany
reached out for the territory of her neighbours. The
pressure of population too large for too narrow
boundaries is as certain in its consequences as is the
pressure of steam in a tea kettle with the spout
stopped up. There’s sure to be an explosion. Germany
exploded. Back of her military system, it is
her maternity system that is responsible for the woe
of the world to-day. It’s plain that the way not to
have war anywhere ever again is not to have too
many babies!</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill, the great economist who two
generations ago looked into the future and saw a
vision of the woman movement that would be, said:
“Little advance can be expected in morality until
the production of large families is regarded in the
same light as drunkenness or any other physical
excess.” And he added: “Among the probable
consequences of the industrial and social independence
of women, I predict a great diminution of the
evil of overpopulation.” John Stuart Mill meant
Mrs. Webber and Mrs. Smith. Two children to be
enjoyed instead of ten to be endured, is an ideal of
family policy possible of attainment even in the east
ends and the east sides of the world. For to Mrs.
Webber or to Mrs. Smith, handling her own wage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
envelope, no one any more may say, “I shall not
give you money for shoes to-morrow unless—” Volitional
motherhood is the final truth that shall make
women free. No one can compel the new woman
to be anything that she does not wish to be, not even
to be a mother until she chooses the time.</p>

<p>After that curse pronounced upon Eve, there was
a promise: “The seed of the woman shall bruise
the serpent’s head!” “We can do it, dear.” That’s
what the new woman will say triumphantly to the
man who comes back to her from the Great War.
Together they will take up the task of making, not
only a new earth, but a new race!</p>

<p>And I think he will be glad for what she tells him.
The wonder is, not so much that women in the past
were willing to endure the “subjection of women,”
but that men consented to it. A bird in a cage can
of course be made to eat out of the hand of the
owner who feeds it. But see the bird that is free
and will come at your call!</p>

<p>The women in industry and commerce and the
professions and in government, whom we are seeing
in these years of war passing all barriers, will at last
make their final stand for what? It is for happiness.
Look! Even now, who has the vision to discern,
may discover the gates of Eden swinging wide.
And when the man in khaki, with the age-old yearning
in his heart, “Woman wanted, my woman,”
comes back to clasp her in his arms once more, these
two everywhere shall enter in. For the ultimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
programme toward which the modern woman movement
to-day is moving is no less than paradise regained!
It may even, I think, have been worth this
war to be there.</p>
